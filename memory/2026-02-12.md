## BotWhiteFam Group Chat (Telegram)
- Group: **BotWhiteFam** — 4 members
- Members: Jason, Dad (David), Flux (@FluxOpenClawBot), DianaMoon (@DianaMoon42bot)
- Diana = David's AI bot, also OpenClaw (claude-opus-4-5)
- Jason gave both bots admin access
- Jason wants the bots to interact / Diana to "teach" Flux
- Context lost during compaction — logged now to prevent recurrence

## Tailscale Setup (In Progress)
- Our IP: 100.64.246.84 (jjflux11@ tailnet)
- David's IP: 100.65.223.73 (diana@ tailnet, shared to us)
- David's gateway: http://100.65.223.73:18789
- David's gateway token: 0d8067a8448ee167523a31bb07fcea7670465a8102b44c70
- Status: Can reach machine, but David's gateway still bound to loopback — needs `bind: tailnet` + restart
- Our gateway already set to `bind: tailnet` ✅
- Diana bot: @DianaMoon42bot, runs claude-opus-4-5
