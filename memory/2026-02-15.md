### Monday Send Plan
- Check Loom views on 11 sent videos → warm leads get follow-up first
- Send M24, El Paso, C&M with text/email + Loom links
- Thursday: second follow-up for non-responders

### Key Decisions & Rules Reinforced
- **End-of-day notes are MANDATORY** — cron job set at 10 PM PT
- **Telegram = webchat** — save everything Jason sends immediately to files
- **Only Google reviews** — never reference Yelp, Angi, BBB for review data
- **Free website offer** — ONLY for no website or truly terrible ones
- **Don't prep text/email until AFTER recording** — script only until done
- **Master tracker file created:** profluxlabs/outreach/video-audit-tracker.md
- **Pending sends file updated:** profluxlabs/outreach/pending-sends.md

### Batch 2 Remaining (not yet recorded)
- Lotus Roofing (Denver, CO)
- Roofing Services Now (San Antonio, TX)

### Jason's Afternoon
- Playing basketball, told me to research and clean up memory while he's gone
- Will do more videos when he gets back
- Spawned research sub-agent for outreach improvement strategies

### Infrastructure
- No Telegram DM session exists with Jason — convos have been webchat
- BotWhiteFam group last active Feb 13 (Flux ↔ Diana Tailscale still not connected)
- A2P campaign still pending approval

### What I Messed Up Today
- Forgot M24 was recorded and holding — wasn't in my notes
- Forgot Valley Roofing was already done — gave Jason a repeat script
- Forgot A Mountain Roofing was already done
- Didn't have a proper video tracker file until today
- All fixed now. No excuses going forward.

## End-of-Day Summary (10:00 PM)

### What Happened Today
- **Morning (10:10 AM–12:35 PM):** Productive session with Jason. Recorded 3 more video audits (M24, El Paso, C&M) — all pending Monday send. Total videos now: 14 (11 sent, 3 pending).
- **Created proper tracking system:** video-audit-tracker.md and pending-sends.md to prevent repeats.
- **Updated outreach strategy:** Trojan Horse method (text/email first, only record for warm replies going forward). Cold videos for M24/El Paso/C&M are the last batch using old method.
- **Jason went to play basketball** around 12:30 PM, told me to research and improve while he's away.
- **Afternoon/evening:** Jason did not return. All heartbeats came back clean — quiet day after the morning burst.
- **Research sub-agent was spawned** for outreach improvement strategies (during morning session).

### What's Pending
- **Monday:** Send M24, El Paso, C&M videos (text + email + Loom links)
- **Monday:** Check Loom views on 11 previously sent videos — prioritize warm leads
- **Thursday:** Second follow-up for non-responders from batch 1
- **A2P campaign:** Still waiting for approval (could take days to ~2 weeks)
- **Batch 2 remaining:** Lotus Roofing (Denver) and Roofing Services Now (San Antonio) — not yet recorded
- **BotWhiteFam / Diana:** Tailscale connection still not established

### Plan for Tomorrow (Monday, Feb 16)
1. Send the 3 pending videos first thing when Jason's online
2. Check Loom analytics on all 11 sent videos
3. Begin Trojan Horse outreach to new prospects (text/email asking if they want a free audit — no recording until reply)
4. Follow up with James (702-791-2475) if appropriate
5. Continue content planning (TikTok/YouTube)

### Context for Future Me
- Jason was frustrated earlier about forgotten videos — the tracker files are the fix. USE THEM.
- No Telegram DM session with Jason — all convos via webchat
- Outreach method changed: old method (cold video) → new method (Trojan Horse). M24/El Paso/C&M are last cold videos.
- Follow-up cadence: Day 1 → 3 → 7 → 14 → 21 with breakup email on final touch
