# 2026-02-10 — Day 1

## Setup & Identity
- Flux ⚡ came online, established identity with Jason
- Telegram bot paired (@FluxOpenClawBot), WhatsApp connected
- Chrome installed on Mac mini, logged into GHL

## GHL Progress
- Audited all 3 existing sub-accounts (Demo, LeadFlow, ProFlux Labs) — all empty
- GHL plan: $297/mo SaaS Pro, unlimited sub-accounts, next invoice Mar 5
- Started creating new "Roofer Pro Template" sub-account via browser automation
- Form filled: name, email, phone (9259990285), address (12 Highland Cove Lane, Henderson, NV 89012), country (US)
- **Timezone dropdown still pending** — need to set America/Los_Angeles then submit
- Old sub-accounts deferred to Jason for manual deletion (checkbox selection unreliable via automation)

## ProFluxLabs Strategy
- Agreed on pricing: $997-$1,500/mo + $1,000-$2,500 setup fee (Jason originally wanted $200/mo)
- 3-tier: Starter ($997), Pro ($1,497), Elite ($2,497)
- Niche: roofers — miss calls, not tech-savvy, high job values ($5-15k+)
- Stage 1: Agency → Stage 2: SaaS → Stage 3: Brand empire
- YouTube: Jason on camera (not AI avatar) — pro athlete + looks + AI = unique brand

## Sub-agents Spawned
- roofer-research → profluxlabs/roofer-market-research.md
- outreach-materials → profluxlabs/outreach/, pricing/, sales/
- automation-blueprint → profluxlabs/system/automation-blueprint.md

## Config
- Brave Search API key added (BSAKUAZGror7gS6-oUibfeTEmL-ghAR) — gateway restarting to apply
- Jason asked what else would power me up: email, calendar, ElevenLabs, Twitter, GitHub suggested

## Late Night
- Jason asked about Alyx Vance wallpapers (Half-Life fan) — couldn't search without Brave key at the time
- Jason at gym earlier, available on Telegram
