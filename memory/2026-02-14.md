## Video Audit Outreach — Day 2

4. **LFP Restoration** (North LV) — script given, awaiting recording. Phone (702) 334-3575, email info@lfprestoration.com. Google: 4.9 stars / 67 reviews. Restoration company that also does roofing — angle is review volume (67 vs competitors' 200-300) and roofing services buried on their site.

Jason said: stick to west coast for now.

### Memphis Roofing LLC (saved for later)
- Germantown/Memphis, TN — owner David, (901) 402-4040
- In business since 1989, 35+ years, NO website, 14 Yelp reviews
- Perfect free website candidate — but Jason wants west coast only for now

## Script Format (LOCKED IN — see MEMORY.md)
- 4 tabs: Google reviews → competitor search → their website → ProFluxLabs
- Step-by-step with tab directions
- NO "look at camera"
- End with energy + specific dollar loss numbers
- Free website is an EXTRA, not a requirement — still pitch companies with good websites
- Updated text CTA: added "or just reply to this text and I'll send more info"

## Strategy Updates
- Now sending on ALL contact methods (text + email + any other found)
- Added softer CTA to texts: "or just reply to this text and I'll send more info"
- Monday follow-up plan: check Loom views → follow up with warm leads first → second follow-up Thursday
- Batch-prepping targets ahead so Jason can record back-to-back without waiting

## Key Lessons Learned Today
- NEVER use third-party sites (Birdeye, Yelp, Angi) for Google review data — ALWAYS check Google directly. Jason corrected me on LFP Restoration (I said 4.5/31, actual was 4.9/67).
- Don't restart script format between days — carry forward what works
- Free website is a bonus hook, not a requirement. Core offer is the AI follow-up system. Still target companies with good websites.
- Jason picks targets too — he found LFP Restoration himself via Google Local Services
