## Sales Call - Prospect 7027912475
- Jason cold called an older roofer who's skeptical of AI and considering closing his business
- Guy wouldn't budge on a 15-min demo meeting, even with free trial / heavy discount offers
- Drafted a follow-up text focusing on "save your business" angle rather than "AI is cool"
- Key reframe: position service as "never miss a lead" not "AI automation"
- Text ready to send, couldn't deliver via Telegram due to DNS issue

## ProFluxLabs Website — LIVE
- Built landing page + privacy policy + terms of service
- Deployed to Netlify: https://profluxlabs.netlify.app
- Privacy: https://profluxlabs.netlify.app/privacy
- Terms: https://profluxlabs.netlify.app/terms
- Created Netlify account under jjflux11@gmail.com (password: ProFlux2026!)
- Purpose: needed for A2P 10DLC registration (compliance website requirement)
- A2P first attempt rejected (no live website)
- Resubmitted A2P with live website URL ✅
- Brand approval: up to 7 days, campaign: 2-3 weeks after
- Jason may get OTP text for TCR verification
- Second submission ALSO failed — likely missing opt-in form + OTP verification
- Added opt-in form with Terms/Privacy checkboxes + SMS consent checkbox to website
- Root causes researched: need opt-in form, OTP verification, legal name = Jason White not ProFlux Labs
- Third attempt: GHL compliance review showed specific failures per section
- Fixed all Privacy Policy (7/7) and Terms of Service (7/7) issues — those now pass
- Opt-in Form had 2 remaining failures: "Business name clearly displayed" + "Message frequency disclosure"
- Fixed: made business name more prominent with card/background, added specific frequency "up to 10 messages/month"
- Deployed fix, Jason resubmitting — awaiting result
- After multiple iterations, all 8/8 opt-in checks passed
- BUT brand registration still rejected instantly — turned out to be **Gmail as brand support email** (error 30881)
- Set up email forwarding: jason@profluxlabs.app → jwhite1130@gmail.com via Porkbun
- Resubmitted with custom domain email — **BRAND APPROVED** ✅
- Campaign status: "In progress" — takes a few days to ~2 weeks
- OTP verification completed via text

## Video Audit Outreach
- Jason decided to focus on video audits as primary outreach (over cold calling)
- Using Loom Chrome extension to record screen + face cam
- Created 10 target companies with custom scripts: profluxlabs/outreach/video-audit-targets.md
- Jason prefers detailed step-by-step instructions (which tab to show, what to say on each)
- He's not spending on ads yet — wants to get reps in and learn to convert first
- Saved 20 outreach strategies to profluxlabs/outreach/strategies.md

### Videos Recorded (Feb 13)
1. **FT Construction & Roofing** (LV) — Loom 3a4ccbf7 — text sent to (702) 889-1688
2. **Colonial Roofing** (Dallas) — Loom 52ce791e — text sent to (214) 634-0805
3. **D&L Roofing** (LV) — Loom 1d97ad5c — text to (702) 260-1114 + email to info@dandlroofing.com
4. **M R Roofing** (LV) — Loom ffa99e3f — text attempted to (702) 522-1991 but number is DEAD, website blank/broken. Likely out of business. Skip.
5. **A Step Above Inc.** (LV) — Loom cb6e28d8 — phone (702) 810-7479 is LANDLINE (no text). Sent via website contact form + Yelp message instead. 42 Google reviews, 17yr business, asairoofing.com. Strong prospect.
6. **Redstone Roofing LLC** (LV) — Loom 2379a93a — text sent to (702) 306-7078, website redstonerooflv.com (outdated). Free website offer angle. Also try FB DM + Yelp. Note: Yelp has someone asking "are they still in business?"

### Queued (not yet recorded)
7. **First Quality Roofing & Insulation** (LV) — (702) 262-7847, firstqualityroof.com (decent site). 4.3 stars Google, 73 Yelp, BBB A+ since 2006, GAF Master Elite. Buried in search. Angi reviews mention missed follow-ups/estimates = perfect pitch for lead capture system. NO free website — straight value prop. Script ready in chat, just say "First Quality."

### Session ended
- Loom was lagging badly, Jason couldn't record more
- 6 videos completed on first day of Loom outreach — great momentum

### Key Learnings
- Google Reviews matter most (not Yelp) for roofer search visibility
- Companies with 300+ Google reviews are too established to target — look for <50
- **Free website makeover = killer Trojan horse** — costs us 30 min, perceived value $2-5K, gets foot in door, then upsell to $997/mo lead management
- Target roofers with no/bad website + low reviews = best prospects
- Some business phone numbers are landlines (can't text) — need fallback: website contact form, Yelp message, email, or cold call Monday
- Some numbers are dead = business likely closed — skip quickly
- Jason naturally good at recording, cranking them out fast

## Website Polish (sub-agent)
- Added: sticky nav, hero with glow/grid effects, "How It Works" 3-step section, testimonial, scroll animations, Inter font, 4-column footer
- Privacy + Terms pages updated to match branding
- Fully mobile responsive
- Deployed to Netlify ✅

## A2P Registration
- Sole proprietor campaign (no EIN)
- First submission rejected instantly (no website)
- Need to resubmit with profluxlabs.netlify.app as business URL
- Once approved: buy phone number → test missed call text-back workflow

## Follow-Up Text Sent to Roofer (James, 702-791-2475)
- Jason sent the "save your business" follow-up text via iMessage (green bubble = SMS/Android)
- Sent as-is from the draft we made
- Pricing quoted: $997/mo — guy said "that's a lot"
- Advised Jason: don't drop price, offer free 2-week trial instead

## Creative Outreach Ideas (for Jason to review later)
- Gave Jason 10 alternative outreach methods beyond cold calling
- Top 3 recommended: video audits, FB ads to roofers, TikTok/YouTube content funnel
- Jason's friend confirmed cold calling conversion rates are low (~1-2%)
- Jason still plans to cold call but wants to diversify

## GHL Status Clarification
- GHL Roofer Pro Template is COMPLETE (was confused by outdated checklist)
- Updated ghl-setup-checklist.md to reflect actual status
- Only untested: manual end-to-end test of workflows (need phone number first, blocked by A2P)

## Accounts Created This Session
- Netlify: jjflux11@gmail.com / ProFlux2026!

## Telegram DNS Issue
- Telegram API sends failing with "Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!"
- Root cause: Mac mini DNS is pointed solely at Tailscale DNS (100.100.100.100)
- `nslookup` resolves api.telegram.org fine, but curl/Node.js can't resolve it
- Bypassing DNS with `--resolve` to the IP (149.154.166.110) works → confirmed DNS-only issue
- Fix: restart Tailscale or add fallback DNS (8.8.8.8) in network settings
- WhatsApp also had a disconnect earlier (status 428 at 06:12 PST) but showed OK in status check

## WhatsApp Gateway Disconnect
- System logged WhatsApp disconnect at 06:12 PST (status 428)
- By 08:05 it showed as OK/linked in openclaw status
