## Morning Session
- Jason back online ~9am, ready to work on GHL template
- WhatsApp had ~7 disconnect/reconnect cycles overnight (408/428 errors) — no work done overnight
- Confirmed GHL still logged in on openclaw browser
- Found all 4 sub-accounts exist: Demo Account, LeadFlow System Template, ProFlux Labs, **Roofer Pro Template** (created Feb 10)
- Roofer Pro Template WAS successfully created yesterday (missed it initially, was below scroll)
- Jason prefers working through me (I control browser, he directs via chat)

## GHL Template Build Progress
Two sub-agent sessions ran to build the Roofer Pro Template:

**✅ Completed:**
- Roofing Sales Pipeline (7 stages: New Lead → Contacted → Estimate Scheduled → Estimate Given → Follow-Up → Won → Lost)
- 6 Custom Fields (Lead Source, Roof Type, Property Type, Estimated Job Value, Storm Damage, Insurance Claim)
- 11 Tags (missed-call, form-lead, chat-lead, ad-lead, hot-lead, review-requested, review-left, do-not-contact, contacted, new-lead, job-completed)
- 5 Calendars in "Roofing Services" group (Roof Installation, Schedule an Appointment, Roof Repair, Roof Inspection, Roof Replacement)
- 4 Workflow shells (Missed Call Text-Back, New Lead Follow-Up, Appointment Reminders, Review Request)

**⚠️ Needs manual work:**
- All 4 workflow shells need internal steps filled in (triggers, SMS actions, waits, conditions)
- GHL workflow builder requires too many granular clicks for full browser automation

**💡 Discovery:**
- 7 pre-built marketing workflows already exist in the template (possibly from GHL defaults):
  - Appointment Confirmation & Reminder Texts
  - Fast 5-Min Lead Follow-Up (Form Submission)
  - Inactive Leads Re-Engagement
  - Long-Term Education & Value Follow-Ups
  - Missed Appointment Follow-Up (Reschedule)
  - Post-Job Review Request (Customer Feedback)
  - Voice AI Flashcard Summary
- These may overlap with our custom workflows — need to review with Jason

Sent Jason a Telegram update asking him to review together.

## Workflow Customization (3 sub-agent sessions)
- Missed Call Text-Back: fully customized (SMS, tag, push notification, internal SMS)
- Missed Appointment Follow-Up: both SMS messages updated
- Fast 5-Min Lead Follow-Up: 1st SMS updated, but needs 5 more SMS+Wait actions added
- Appointment Confirmation: 1hr reminder SMS updated, needs confirmation + 24hr SMS added
- Post-Job Review Request: SMS lives in Reputation Settings, not workflow editor
- Inactive Leads Re-Engagement: no SMS actions exist, needs 2 added
- Deleted 4 empty shell workflows

## Full Audit Results
- Pipeline: ✅ 7 stages
- Custom Fields: ✅ all 6
- Tags: ✅ all 11
- Calendars: ✅ all 5 Active (fixed during audit)
- Workflows: 7 total (deleted Voice AI Flashcard Summary), all Draft
- Deleted default Marketing Pipeline — only Roofing Sales Pipeline remains
- Business profile: incomplete (no logo, email, legal name — per-client onboarding)
- Template ~95% done

## Late Session — Workflow Editing
- Jason took over manual editing for: Inactive Leads Re-Engagement, Fast 5-Min Lead Follow-Up, Appointment Confirmation & Reminder, Post-Job Review Request
- All confirmed finished by Jason
- Fast 5-Min Lead Follow-Up still open in browser (tab 41F74E713A67F10C482BE188B55D6DD9) with Actions panel open — was adding Wait+SMS pairs for SMS 2-6
- Remaining cleanup: edit Long-Term Education workflow (or delete it), move calendar if needed, business profile fields
- SMS copy should NOT hardcode "free inspection" — per-client customization during onboarding

## Outreach System Built (sub-agent, ~6min)
All 8 files created in profluxlabs/outreach/ and profluxlabs/sales/:
- cold-call-script.md — pattern interrupt opener, 30-sec pitch, voicemail scripts
- ai-cold-calling-research.md — AI cold calling is ILLEGAL under TCPA ($500-1500/call fines). Use manual calls for outbound, AI for inbound/warm only.
- prospecting-strategy.md — 7 channels, target hail belt cities (DFW, Denver, OKC, KC)
- prospect-list.md — 25 starter roofers across those cities
- automated-outreach-system.md — Instantly.ai ($97/mo), 5 burner domains, ~345 touches/day in <1hr work
- scenario-playbook.md — 8 scenarios including no-references workaround, trial handling, onboarding checklist
- demo-script.md — 15-min demo with live missed-call demo moment
- one-pager-text.md — clean text version for DM/WhatsApp (no tables)
- Total outreach system cost: ~$175-225/mo

## Post-Job Review Request
- Review SMS lives in Reputation Settings, not workflow editor
- Default template was already fine (has {{contact.name}}, {{location.name}}, {{reputation.review_link}})
- Jason confirmed it looked good

## Deleted Long-Term Education workflow
- Jason agreed to delete it — untouched default, not needed for Phase 1
- Now down to 6 workflows total

## Template Status: COMPLETE
- 7-stage pipeline, 6 custom fields, 11 tags, 5 calendars, 6 workflows
- Per-client onboarding items: logo, phone, email, legal name, SMS language swap, Draft→Published

## Workflow Testing — Failed
- Sub-agent couldn't automate GHL browser (blank pages, timeouts — same recurring issue)
- Recommended Jason do a quick 10-min manual test instead
- Real test happens with first live client anyway

## Next Steps (when Jason returns from reading)
1. Set up Cal.com or Calendly for ProFluxLabs demo bookings
2. Buy 5 burner domains for cold email (~$60)
3. Sign up for Instantly.ai ($97/mo), start warming emails (2 weeks)
4. Scrape/verify prospect list with real contact info
5. Start cold calling while emails warm
- Jason's daily schedule: 9-10 prospect research, 10-12 calls, 12-1 content, 1-2 DMs, 2-3 follow-ups

## Other
- Jason watching Charlie Morgan's Imperium Academy on Skool (free course on agency sales)
- Advised to cherry-pick sales/cold-calling sections, skip niche/offer stuff
- Jason plans to focus on outreach once GHL is fully set up
- Outreach materials already built in profluxlabs/outreach/ and profluxlabs/sales/
