## End-of-Day Note (MANDATORY)
- At 10:00 PM PT daily, write a summary note in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` covering:
  - What happened today
  - What's pending / in progress
  - What's the plan for tomorrow
  - Any decisions made or context future-me needs
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Jason explicitly requested this.
