## Strategy

- Stage 3: Brand empire (courses, community)
- Focus ruthlessly — agency + content only, everything else iced

## A2P Registration
- **Brand: APPROVED** ✅ (Feb 13, 2026)
- **Campaign: In progress** — waiting for approval (days to ~2 weeks)
- Root causes of prior rejections: no website, missing opt-in form, Gmail as brand email
- Fixed by: deploying website, adding compliant opt-in form, custom domain email (jason@profluxlabs.app)
- Once campaign approved → buy phone number → test missed call text-back workflow

## Cold Email Infrastructure
- Domains warming up in **Instantly** (set up before Feb 16)
- Multiple domains being warmed — check Instantly dashboard for status/details
- Once warm → use for Trojan Horse cold email outreach

## Infrastructure Notes
- Mac mini DNS pointed solely at Tailscale (100.100.100.100) — causes intermittent API resolution failures
- Fix: add fallback DNS (8.8.8.8) or restart Tailscale when Telegram/external APIs fail

## Prospect Notes
- James (702-791-2475): older roofer, skeptical of AI, considering closing business. Follow-up "save your business" text sent Feb 13. Quoted $997/mo, he balked. Don't discount — offer free trial.

## Comms Rules
- **Telegram messages = webchat messages.** Any info Jason sends on Telegram gets written to files immediately — Loom links, decisions, updates, everything. No "mental notes."
- Jason's Telegram: @Jx_CryptoFlux (ID: 6000033769)

## Critical Process Rules
- **NEVER lose data.** Every Loom link, every company, every contact detail gets written to a file IMMEDIATELY.
- **Video audit tracker:** `profluxlabs/outreach/video-audit-tracker.md` — master list of all videos (recorded, sent, skipped)
- **Pending sends:** `profluxlabs/outreach/pending-sends.md` — videos ready to send with Loom links + contact info
- **Script flow:** Prep script → Jason records → Jason sends Loom link → I save link to pending-sends → We send together on planned day
- **Don't prep text/email until AFTER Jason records** — script only until recording is done
- **End-of-day notes:** Cron job at 10 PM PT writes daily summary to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — NON-NEGOTIABLE

## Outreach Method (Updated Feb 15)
- **Phase 1: Trojan Horse** — send short text/email asking if they want a free video audit. DON'T record until they reply.
- **Phase 2: Record & Send** — only for warm replies. Way more efficient, better close rate.
- **Follow-up cadence:** Day 1 → 3 → 7 → 14 → 21. Don't quit early — 80% of deals close after 5+ touches.
- **Breakup email on final touch** — gets highest response rate.
- **Never lead with "AI"** — lead with money and missed calls. Frame as lead capture system.
- **Mystery shopper angle** — call their business, expose the response gap, use it in the pitch.
- **Trojan Horse channels:** ALL THREE — text + email + cold call. Send text/email same time, call highest-value targets too.
- **Cold videos (M24, El Paso, C&M) were old method** — send those Monday, then switch to new method going forward.

## Loom Video Audit Script Format
- Step-by-step with which tab/page is open at each step
- 4 tabs: Google reviews → competitor search → their website → ProFluxLabs
- NO "look at camera" step — stay on screen the whole time
- Keep the tone natural, match the style from the first batch (Feb 13)
- Don't restart the format each new day — carry forward what works
- End with energy + specific dollar loss numbers
- Free website offer is an EXTRA — only for companies with NO website or truly terrible ones. Don't offer for basic/generic sites.
- Updated text CTA: added "or just reply to this text and I'll send more info"
- Send on ALL contact methods (text + email + any other found)
- Don't prep text/email until AFTER Jason records — script only until recording is done

## Research Rules
- ALWAYS use Google reviews for star rating and review count — never trust third-party sites (Birdeye, Yelp, Angi, etc.) for Google data
- Third-party listings are often outdated or wrong

## 🔴 Flux Operating Standard (from Jason, Feb 16 2026)
- **ALWAYS think: "What's the 10/10 way to do this?"** — never settle for surface-level work
- If research takes <15 min and the info is gold, GO DEEPER — find 10-20 more sources unprompted
- Pull actual transcripts, read full articles, cross-reference. No shortcuts.
- Ask Jason to unblock access if something is limiting me — he WANTS me to have full freedom
- I am the key. Act like it. Every single time.

## Lessons & Notes
- Jason responds well to direct honesty — don't sugarcoat
- He wanted $200/mo pricing, I pushed to $1k+ and he agreed immediately
- He was open to changing the AI avatar idea when I made the case
- He values opinions, not yes-men
- He gets frustrated when I forget things — data retention is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- ALWAYS write info to files immediately, never rely on session memory
- Jason tells me every video he records — track it the moment he says it
- He wants me to be a true partner, not just a tool — learn, research, improve on my own time
- When he's away, use the time productively (research, memory cleanup, prep)
