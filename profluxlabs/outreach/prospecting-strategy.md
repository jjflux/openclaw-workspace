# Prospecting Strategy — Finding Roofer Leads

---

## TARGET PROFILE

**Ideal prospect:**
- Small-mid size roofing company (1-20 employees, owner-operated)
- Google reviews: 3.5-5.0 stars, 10-200 reviews (established but not enterprise)
- No fancy website chat widget (means they're NOT already using automation)
- Active on Facebook/Instagram (easy to DM)
- Located in storm-prone markets (hail, wind, hurricane zones)
- Likely answer their own phone or have minimal office staff

**Red flags (skip these):**
- Huge companies (50+ employees) — they have systems already
- No online presence at all — too hard to sell digital solutions to
- Bad reviews (below 3 stars) — they have bigger problems than missed calls
- Already using GHL or similar platform — harder to displace

## TOP PROSPECTING CHANNELS

### 1. Google Maps Scraping (BEST SOURCE) ⭐
**Tools:**
- **Outscraper** ($0.002/result, free tier available) — scrapes Google Maps for business name, phone, website, rating, review count, address
- **Scrap.io** — similar, clean interface
- **Apify Google Maps Scraper** — $49/mo, very flexible
- **Clay** — $149/mo, combines scraping + enrichment + outreach

**How to use:**
1. Search "roofing company" + [city] on Google Maps
2. Scrape all results
3. Filter by: 10+ reviews, 3.5+ stars, has phone number, has website
4. Check website — if no chat widget/booking system, they're a prospect

**Volume:** Can pull 200-500 roofers per city in minutes

### 2. Yelp
- Search "roofing" by city
- Good for finding small operations with reviews
- Phone numbers publicly listed
- Manual process but high-quality leads

### 3. BBB (Better Business Bureau)
- bbb.org → search "roofing contractors" by city
- Filter by accredited businesses
- Shows complaints (helps qualify)
- Often shows owner name

### 4. Facebook Groups
- Search "roofing contractors [state]" or "roofers of [state]"
- Join groups, observe who's active
- DON'T pitch in the group — DM individuals
- Great for building relationships before selling

### 5. HomeAdvisor / Angi
- Lists roofers by city with reviews
- Often shows number of employees
- Can identify who's actively seeking leads (they're on the platform for a reason)

### 6. Google Search (Manual but High Quality)
- Search "roofing company [city]" and go past the ads
- Check page 2-3 of results — these are roofers who NEED better marketing
- Visit their website, check for automation gaps

### 7. Instantly / Apollo Lead Database
- Instantly has 450M+ B2B contacts with email addresses
- Search by industry (roofing), location, company size
- ~$97/mo for Hypergrowth plan with lead database access
- Best for cold EMAIL prospecting at scale
