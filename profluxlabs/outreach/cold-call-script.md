# Cold Call Script — Roofers

> Goal: Book a 15-minute demo. That's it. Don't sell the product on the call — sell the meeting.

## LIVE CALL SCRIPT

### Opening (Pattern Interrupt)

**You:** "Hey [First Name], this is Jason with ProFluxLabs — I know you didn't expect this call, so I'll be quick. Got 30 seconds?"

> If they say yes, go straight to the pitch. If they say "who is this?" — repeat your name, say "I work with roofing companies in [their city]" and ask for 30 seconds.

### The Pitch (30 Seconds)

**You:** "So here's why I'm calling — I work with roofing companies and we solve one specific problem: missed calls turning into lost jobs. When you're on a roof and someone calls, right now that lead just... disappears. We built a system that instantly texts them back, captures their info, and follows up automatically so you don't lose that $8-15K job. Most roofers we talk to are missing 5-10 calls a week and don't even realize it."

### Qualifying Questions

> Pick 2-3, don't interrogate them.

1. "When someone calls and you can't answer, what happens right now? Does it just go to voicemail?"
2. "How many calls would you say you miss during a typical week on the job?"
3. "Do you have someone in the office answering phones, or is it mostly you?"
4. "How are you getting most of your leads right now — word of mouth, Google, ads?"
5. "If I told you this system pays for itself with one saved lead per month, would that be worth looking at?"

### Transition to Close

**If they're engaged:**

"Look, I don't want to take up your whole day — you've got jobs to run. Can I show you exactly how this works in a quick 15-minute call? I'll pull up the dashboard, show you what it looks like when a missed call gets caught, and you can decide if it makes sense. No pressure, no contracts. How's [Tuesday/Thursday] morning look?"

**If they push back ("I'm busy / not interested"):**

"Totally get it — you're running a business, not sitting around waiting for sales calls. Here's what I'll do: I'll shoot you a quick text with a one-pager. If it makes sense, hit me back. If not, no hard feelings. Fair?"

> Then text them the one-pager immediately after hanging up.

**If they ask about price:**

"Depends on what you need, but our starter plan is under a grand a month — and most roofers make that back from one saved lead. That's why I want to show you the demo first, so you can see the actual ROI. Can we do 15 minutes this week?"

### Hard Close (if they're warm but stalling)

"I'll be straight with you — every day you don't have something catching those missed calls, you're leaving money on the table. I'm not asking you to sign anything, just watch a quick demo. Worst case, you learn something. What do you say?"

## VOICEMAIL SCRIPT

> Keep it under 20 seconds. Speak like a human, not a telemarketer.

**Version 1 (Casual):**

"Hey [First Name], it's Jason with ProFluxLabs. Quick one for you — I help roofers capture the leads they lose from missed calls. If you're missing even a few calls a week while you're on a job, that's potentially $10K+ walking away. Shoot me a text at [number] if you want to see how it works. Talk soon."

**Version 2 (Curiosity-Based):**

"Hey [First Name], Jason here. I've got a question for you — do you know how many calls you missed last week while you were on a roof? For most roofers it's 5-10, and each one could be an $8K+ job. I built something that fixes that. Text me at [number] or I'll try you again Thursday. Later."

## KEY RULES

1. **Never say "How are you doing today?"** — instant telemarketer flag
2. **Get to the point in 10 seconds** — they'll hang up if you don't
3. **Talk money, not features** — "$8K job" beats "automated text-back system"
4. **Always offer a specific day/time** — "How's Tuesday?" not "When works for you?"
5. **If they say no, leave gracefully** — "No worries, I'll shoot you a text in case things change. Good luck on the jobs."
6. **Best times to call:** 7-8 AM (before they're on a roof) or 4-6 PM (wrapping up)
7. **Call Tuesday-Thursday** — Monday they're slammed, Friday they've checked out
8. **Always text after a voicemail** — "Hey [Name], just left you a VM. Here's what I was calling about. Book a quick demo: https://cal.com/profluxlabs/demo"
9. **Track everything** — log every call, outcome, and follow-up date
10. **Smile when you talk** — sounds dumb, but they can hear it
