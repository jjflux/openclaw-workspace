## COLD EMAIL AUTOMATION

### Recommended Tool: Instantly.ai ⭐

**Why Instantly over alternatives:**
- **$97/mo (Hypergrowth)** — unlimited email accounts, unlimited warmup, 450M+ lead database
- Smartlead ($39-79/mo) is solid but charges $29/client for white-label — not needed yet
- Lemlist ($69-99/mo per user) is per-seat pricing — gets expensive fast
- Instantly is the best bang-for-buck for a solo operator scaling outreach

**What you get:**
- Connect unlimited sending email accounts
- Built-in email warmup (critical)
- Lead database with 450M+ B2B contacts (search by industry/location)
- AI-powered reply detection
- Automatic sequence management
- Analytics dashboard

### Domain Warming Strategy (DO NOT SKIP)

**Rule #1: Never send cold email from your main domain (profluxlabs.com)**

**Setup:**
1. Buy 3-5 similar domains:
   - profluxlabs.co
   - profluxlabshq.com
   - getproflux.com
   - profluxlabs.io
   - tryproflux.com
2. Cost: ~$10-15/domain/year = $50-75 total
3. Set up Google Workspace on each ($6/mo each) = $18-30/mo
4. Create 2-3 email accounts per domain:
   - jason@profluxlabs.co
   - j@profluxlabshq.com
   - jason@getproflux.com
5. Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC on all domains (Instantly has guides)
6. **Warm for 2-3 weeks** before sending ANY cold email
7. Instantly's built-in warmup handles this automatically — just connect and wait

**Sending Limits (Per Account Per Day):**
- Week 1-2: Warmup only (Instantly handles this)
- Week 3: 10 emails/day per account
- Week 4: 20 emails/day per account
- Week 5+: 30-40 emails/day per account (max — don't push past 50)

**With 5 domains × 2 accounts = 10 sending accounts × 30 emails/day = 300 cold emails/day**

## SOCIAL DM AUTOMATION

### Can You Automate DMs? Sort Of.

**Facebook DMs:**
- **Manual is safest.** Facebook aggressively detects automation and will ban accounts.
- **Semi-automated approach:** Use a VA or set aside 30 min/day to send 10-15 DMs from the scripts we have
- Tools like Dripify (LinkedIn) exist but nothing reliable for FB DMs
- **Risk:** Account ban, marketplace restrictions

**Instagram DMs:**
- Similar to Facebook — automation = risk of ban
- **ManyChat** can automate replies to people who DM YOU (inbound), but not cold outbound
- Manual outreach: 10-15 DMs/day is sustainable without getting flagged

**LinkedIn:**
- **Dripify** ($59/mo) or **Expandi** ($99/mo) — automate connection requests + follow-up messages
- Less relevant for roofers (most aren't active on LinkedIn) but worth testing
- Can send 20-30 connection requests/day safely

**The honest take:** Social DMs should be MANUAL for now. It's more personal, lower risk, and roofers can tell when something is automated. Spend 30 min/day on this.

## LONG-TERM NURTURE (For Non-Buyers)

Create a monthly "value email" that goes to everyone who didn't buy:
- Quick roofing industry tip or stat
- No hard sell — just stay top of mind
- Subtle CTA: "If you're still missing calls, we can fix that. Reply if you want to chat."
- Build this in Instantly as a separate slow-drip campaign

## KPIs TO TRACK

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Cold emails sent/day | 200-300 |
| Email open rate | 40-60% |
| Email reply rate | 3-8% |
| Cold calls/day | 20-30 |
| Call connect rate | 15-25% |
| Demos booked/week | 3-5 |
| Demo → Close rate | 20-30% |
| New clients/month | 2-4 |
| Revenue/month (target) | $2,000-6,000 |

**The math:** 300 emails/day × 5% reply rate = 15 replies/day × 20% book demo = 3 demos/day. Even at 10% close rate, that's 1-2 new clients per week. At $997-1,497/mo each, that's $4K-12K MRR within the first month of full operation.

Reality check: Expect lower numbers initially. 1-2 demos/week and 1-2 clients/month is a realistic Month 1 target. Scale from there.
