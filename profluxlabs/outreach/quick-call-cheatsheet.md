# Quick Call Cheatsheet ⚡

## OPENER
"Hey [Name], this is Jason with ProFluxLabs — I know you didn't expect this call, so I'll be quick. Got 30 seconds?"

## 30-SEC PITCH
"I work with roofing companies and we solve one specific problem: missed calls turning into lost jobs. When you're on a roof and someone calls, that lead just disappears. We built a system that instantly texts them back, captures their info, and follows up automatically so you don't lose that $8-15K job."

## IF THEY'RE INTERESTED → BOOK THE DEMO
"Can I show you exactly how it works in a quick 15-minute call? How's tomorrow morning at 9 or 10?"

*(Once booked)* "Perfect, I'll send you a text with the details."

## IF THEY ASK ABOUT PRICE
"Depends on what you need, but our starter plan is under a grand a month — and most roofers make that back from one saved lead. That's why I want to show you the demo first. Can we do 15 minutes this week?"

## IF THEY PUSH BACK / NOT INTERESTED
"Totally get it. Here's what I'll do: I'll shoot you a quick text with a link. If it makes sense, hit me back. If not, no hard feelings. Fair?"

## IF SECRETARY ANSWERS
"Hey, this is Jason with ProFluxLabs — is the owner available real quick?"

**What's it about?**
"I work with roofing companies in Vegas on their lead capture — just wanted to chat with them for 30 seconds."

**Owner not available:**
"No worries — what's the best time to catch them? And what's their first name?"

**Want to take a message:**
"Sure — just let them know Jason called from ProFluxLabs. I help roofers capture missed calls so they don't lose jobs. I'll try them again tomorrow."

## VOICEMAIL
"Hey [Name], it's Jason with ProFluxLabs. Quick one — I help roofers capture the leads they lose from missed calls. If you're missing even a few calls a week while you're on a job, that's potentially $10K+ walking away. Shoot me a text at (925) 999-0285 if you want to see how it works. Talk soon."

## AFTER EVERY VOICEMAIL — TEXT THEM:
"Hey [Name], this is Jason — just left you a quick voicemail. I work with roofing companies in Vegas to help capture missed calls so you don't lose jobs. If you want to see how it works, here's a quick 15-min demo link: cal.com/profluxlabs/demo"

## RULES
- Don't say "How are you doing today?"
- Get to the point in 10 seconds
- Talk money not features ($8K job > automated text-back system)
- Give specific times ("How's tomorrow at 10?" not "When works?")
- Smile when you talk — they can hear it
