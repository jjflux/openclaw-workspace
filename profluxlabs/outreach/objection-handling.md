# Objection Handling — Roofer Prospects

> Handle these calmly and confidently. Never argue. Acknowledge, reframe, redirect.

## "That's too expensive."

**Response:**

Totally get it. Let me ask you this — what's your average job worth? $8K? $12K?

Our Starter plan is $997/month. If the system saves you even ONE lead that would've ghosted, it's paid for itself 5-10x over. Most roofers lose way more than one lead a month to missed calls.

This isn't an expense — it's the cheapest salesperson you'll ever hire, and it works 24/7.

## "I already have a system / I use ServiceTitan / Jobber / etc."

**Response:**

Nice — that's a good sign, means you take your business seriously. Here's the thing though: those tools are great for managing jobs once you have them. What we do is make sure leads don't slip through the cracks *before* they become a job.

We actually integrate with most CRMs. Think of us as the layer that catches what your current system misses — the calls nobody answers, the leads that don't get followed up fast enough.

## "I don't trust AI / I don't want a robot talking to my customers."

**Response:**

I hear you — and honestly, bad AI is worse than no AI. That's not what this is.

The system sends a simple, natural text message when you miss a call: "Hey, sorry we missed you — how can we help?" It doesn't pretend to be a person. It just makes sure that lead doesn't disappear while you're on a roof.

You stay in control of every conversation. The AI just makes sure you don't lose the chance to have one.

## "I need to think about it."

**Response:**

Totally fair. While you think on it, I'll leave you with this:

Every day without this running is another day where missed calls turn into lost revenue. We can get you set up in about a week, and you can cancel anytime — no long-term contract.

How about I check back with you on [specific day]? That way you've got time but we don't lose momentum.

## "I don't get that many calls."

**Response:**

You might be surprised. Most roofers I talk to think they miss maybe 1-2 calls a week. When we actually look at the data, it's usually 5-10+. Especially during busy season — you're on a roof, your crew's on a roof, nobody's answering.

Even if it's just 2-3 missed calls a week — at $8-15K per job, that's potentially $30-60K a month walking away. The system catches those.

---

## "My receptionist / office manager handles calls."

**Response:**

That's great for business hours. But what about after 5 PM? Weekends? Lunch breaks? When they're on the other line?

Our data shows a huge chunk of leads call outside office hours or when the line is busy. The system fills those gaps — it's not replacing your office manager, it's backing them up so nothing falls through.

---

## "Can you guarantee results?"

**Response:**

I can't guarantee you'll close every lead — that depends on your sales process. What I *can* guarantee is that you'll capture leads you're currently losing.

If your phone rings and nobody answers, right now that lead is gone. With our system, they get a response in seconds and their info is captured. What you do from there is up to you — but at least you'll have the shot.

We also don't lock you in. If it's not working after 90 days, you can walk. But most roofers see ROI in the first month.

---

## "Send me some info and I'll look at it."

**Response:**

For sure — I'll send over a one-pager right now.

But honestly, the best way to see if this fits is a quick 10-minute call. I can show you exactly how it works for roofers in your area, and you can decide from there. No pressure.

How's [specific day/time]?

> **Note:** Always try to convert "send info" into a call. If they insist, send the one-pager and follow up in 48 hours.

## General Rules

1. **Never get defensive.** Their objection is valid to them. Acknowledge it.
2. **Always bring it back to money.** Roofers think in jobs and revenue, not features.
3. **Use specific numbers.** "$8K job" hits harder than "a lot of money."
4. **Create urgency without pressure.** "Every day this isn't running" > "Sign up now."
5. **Offer the easy next step.** 10-minute call, quick demo, free audit. Low commitment.
