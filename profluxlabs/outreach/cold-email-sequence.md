## Email 1: The Hook

**Subject:** {{FirstName}}, quick question about missed calls

**Body:**

Hey {{FirstName}},

I was checking out {{CompanyName}} — solid reviews, great work. Quick question though:

What happens when someone calls you during a job and nobody picks up?

For most roofers, that caller moves on to the next guy. That's a $5-15K job gone because of a missed call.

We built a system that instantly texts back every missed call within seconds — before that lead goes cold. It also captures their info so your team can follow up when you're off the roof.

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how it works? No pitch, just a demo.

## Email 2: The Proof (Send Day 3)

**Subject:** The math on missed calls

**Body:**

Hey {{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up. Here's the math:

- Average roofing job: **$8,000+**
- Missed calls per week for a busy roofer: **5-10**
- Even converting **1 extra lead/month** = **$5-15K in revenue**

Our system costs a fraction of one job. It runs 24/7, never forgets to follow up, and works while you're on the roof.

Roofers using this are closing leads they used to lose. Happy to show you exactly how — takes 15 minutes.

Want me to send over a quick walkthrough?

## Email 3: The Breakup (Send Day 7)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**

Hey {{FirstName}},

I've reached out a couple times — no worries if the timing's off. I get it, you're busy running jobs.

I'll leave you with this: if you're missing calls during the day (and every roofer is), you're leaving money on the table. We fix that with automation that works in the background — no extra staff, no extra effort.

If it ever makes sense to chat, I'm here. Otherwise I'll get out of your hair.

## Notes

- **Best send times:** Tue-Thu, 7-8 AM local (before they're on a roof)
- **Personalization tip:** Reference a recent Google review, a job photo from their Facebook, or their city
- **Follow-up:** If they reply to any email, drop the sequence and go human
