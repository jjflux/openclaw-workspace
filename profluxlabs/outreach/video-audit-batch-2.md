# ProFluxLabs Video Audit Batch 2 — Cold Outreach Targets

**Prepared:** February 14, 2026
**Cities:** El Paso, Phoenix, Houston, Denver, San Antonio, Tucson (6 cities, 7 targets)

> ⚠️ **VERIFY BEFORE RECORDING:** Google review counts and ratings should be confirmed at time of recording as they change frequently. Open the Google listing first to verify stars/count before starting each video.

---

### 🎬 El Paso Roofing Co — El Paso, TX

**Phone:** (915) 691-2723
**Website:** elpasoroofingco.com
**Google:** ~4.3 stars / ~25 reviews (verify before recording)
**BBB:** NOT accredited
**Email:** elpasoroofing@yahoo.com
**Years in business:** 30+

**Problems Found:**
1. Website is visibly outdated — displays "You are using an outdated browser" warning on load, generic template design, no modern features
2. Not BBB accredited despite 30+ years in business — signals lack of trust-building investment
3. Yahoo email address (elpasoroofing@yahoo.com) instead of professional domain email — looks unprofessional to homeowners comparing options

**Website assessment:** Severely outdated — old template, browser compatibility warnings, no online booking, no chat, no reviews displayed. Offer free website upgrade.

**PRE-LOAD THESE 4 TABS:**
1. Their Google reviews (search "El Paso Roofing Co El Paso TX")
2. Google search: "roofing company El Paso" (competitors)
3. Their website: elpasoroofingco.com
4. ProFluxLabs website: profluxlabs.netlify.app

**START ON TAB 1 (their Google listing). Hit record.**

> "Hey, what's up — this is Jason from ProFlux Labs. I'm looking at El Paso Roofing Co right now. You guys have been around for over 30 years, which is solid — that's real experience. But here's the thing — you're sitting at around a 4.3 with not a lot of reviews. For a company with 30 years in the game, you should have way more social proof than this. And when someone in El Paso searches for a roofer, they're going to see competitors stacking up against you."

**CLICK TO TAB 2 (competitor search).**

> "Look at this — when I Google 'roofing company El Paso,' you've got companies like Dependable Roofing, AAAA Contractors, all showing up with more reviews, higher ratings, better visibility. They're grabbing the leads that should be going to you. And here's what most people don't realize — every missed call, every lead that doesn't get followed up within five minutes, that's $5,000 to $15,000 walking out the door. Over a month, that's easily $20K to $30K in lost revenue."

**CLICK TO TAB 3 (their website).**

> "And then there's this — your website. I'm going to be straight with you, this needs some love. It's throwing browser warnings, it looks like it was built years ago, there's no online booking, no chat, no way for someone to instantly connect. Homeowners are comparing you to competitors with modern, clean sites. I'd be happy to level this up for you for free — we build modern roofing websites as part of what we do. No catch. But even beyond the website, the real money leak is in follow-up."

**CLICK TO TAB 4 (ProFluxLabs website).**

> "This is what we built at ProFlux Labs — an AI-powered follow-up system that catches every lead, responds instantly, follows up automatically by text and email, and books appointments while you're on a roof. You're losing jobs right now because leads go cold. We fix that. I put a link below to book a quick call — takes 15 minutes, I'll walk you through exactly how it works for roofing companies. Talk soon."

### 🎬 Valley Roofing & Repair — Phoenix, AZ

**Phone:** (623) 250-7663
**Website:** valleyroofingandrepair.com
**Google:** ~4.5 stars / ~15 reviews (verify before recording)
**BBB:** Accredited since 3/2025 (very new)
**Email:** (not found — use contact form on site)
**Years in business:** ~1-2 years (new company)

**Problems Found:**
1. Extremely thin website — single paragraph of text, no service pages, no reviews displayed, no portfolio of work
2. Very few Google reviews for a roofing company — hard to compete with established Phoenix roofers who have hundreds
3. Brand new BBB accreditation (March 2025) — still building credibility, no established online reputation yet

**Website assessment:** Very thin — one paragraph, no depth, no testimonials, no project photos. Functional but bare-bones. Offer free website upgrade.

**PRE-LOAD THESE 4 TABS:**
1. Their Google reviews (search "Valley Roofing & Repair Phoenix AZ")
2. Google search: "roofing company Phoenix" (competitors)
3. Their website: valleyroofingandrepair.com
4. ProFluxLabs website: profluxlabs.netlify.app

**START ON TAB 1 (their Google listing). Hit record.**

> "Hey — Jason here from ProFlux Labs. Looking at Valley Roofing & Repair in Phoenix right now. So you guys are a newer company, and I can see you're starting to build up reviews — but you're going up against some heavy hitters in this market."

**CLICK TO TAB 2 (competitor search).**

> "When I search 'roofing company Phoenix,' you've got companies like KY-KO, Stonecreek, Rob's Roofing — all with hundreds of reviews. In a competitive market like Phoenix, the companies that respond fastest and follow up the hardest win. Period. And I see this all the time with newer roofing companies — you're spending money on marketing, leads are coming in, but if you're not getting back to people within five minutes, half those leads are already calling the next guy. That's $20K to $30K a month walking out the door."

**CLICK TO TAB 3 (their website).**

> "Now your website — it's clean, but it's really thin. There's basically one paragraph of text, no service breakdowns, no project photos, no reviews on the page. When a homeowner lands here, they need to feel confident in about three seconds. Right now there's not enough here to do that. I'd be happy to build you guys a proper site for free — something with real depth that converts visitors into calls."

**CLICK TO TAB 4 (ProFluxLabs website).**

> "But the real game-changer is this — ProFlux Labs. We built an AI follow-up system specifically for companies like yours. Every lead gets an instant response, automated follow-up sequences by text and email, and appointments get booked while you're out on a job. For a new company trying to grow, this is how you compete with the big guys without hiring a sales team. Link's below to book a quick demo — talk soon."

### 🎬 C&M Roofing & Construction — Houston, TX

**Phone:** (832) 715-3991
**Website:** candmroofing-construction.com
**Google:** ~5.0 stars / ~10 reviews (verify before recording — very new company)
**BBB:** Accredited since 8/2024 (new)
**Email:** (not found — use website contact form)
**Years in business:** ~2 years

**Problems Found:**
1. Almost zero Yelp presence — 0 Yelp reviews means invisible on a major review platform that Houston homeowners use
2. Very few Google reviews — in a massive market like Houston with 4,300+ roofing contractors on BBB alone, you need serious social proof
3. New company competing in one of the most saturated roofing markets in the country — needs aggressive lead capture and follow-up to survive

**Website assessment:** Decent website — modern design, good layout, service pages. Skip free website offer. Go straight to AI follow-up system pitch.

**PRE-LOAD THESE 4 TABS:**
1. Their Google reviews (search "C&M Roofing & Construction Houston TX")
2. Google search: "roofing company Houston" (competitors)
3. Their website: candmroofing-construction.com
4. ProFluxLabs website: profluxlabs.netlify.app

**START ON TAB 1 (their Google listing). Hit record.**

> "Hey — Jason from ProFlux Labs. I'm looking at C&M Roofing & Construction out of Pearland, serving the Houston area. You guys are a newer company, and you've got solid five-star reviews, which is great. But the problem is — you don't have enough of them yet."

**CLICK TO TAB 2 (competitor search).**

> "Check this out — when I search 'roofing company Houston,' you're competing against thousands of contractors. Companies like Houston Roofing & Construction with 300+ reviews, Amstill with 50 years in business. In Houston, this market is brutal. The companies that win aren't necessarily the best roofers — they're the ones that respond fastest and follow up hardest. Every lead that comes in and doesn't get a response within five minutes? That person has already called two other roofers. Over a month, that's $20K to $30K in jobs you never even had a chance at."

**CLICK TO TAB 3 (their website).**

> "Now your website actually looks good — you've got the layout, the services, the process section. So I'm not going to tell you you need a new site. What I am going to tell you is that the biggest money leak for newer companies isn't the website — it's what happens after someone fills out that form or calls and you're on a roof somewhere."

**CLICK TO TAB 4 (ProFluxLabs website).**

> "That's exactly what we solve at ProFlux Labs. We built an AI system that responds to every lead instantly — text, email, even missed calls — follows up automatically on a schedule, and books appointments straight to your calendar. For a company your size trying to grow in Houston, this is the difference between getting five jobs a month and getting twenty. Link's below — grab a quick 15-minute demo and I'll walk you through exactly how it works. Talk soon."

Hey team,

Jason here from ProFlux Labs. I recorded a quick 90-second video audit of your online presence — how your Google listing looks, where you stand in the Houston market, and where the biggest opportunities are.

Your website looks solid, so this isn't about that. It's about what happens after leads come in — the follow-up gap that's costing most small roofing companies $20-30K/month in lost jobs.

### 🎬 Lotus Roofing — Denver, CO

**Phone:** (720) 369-1033
**Website:** lotusroofingcolorado.com
**Google:** ~4.9 stars / ~20 reviews (verify — Trustindex shows 242 reviews for a different Lotus entity, verify which listing)
**BBB:** NOT accredited
**Email:** info@lotusroofingcolorado.com
**Years in business:** ~3-4 years

**Problems Found:**
1. Website has broken layout — repeated "Our Services" headers (appears 6 times), incomplete warranty text ("comprehensive 10 warranty" — missing the word "year"), looks like a rushed GoDaddy/Wix template
2. Not BBB accredited — in a market where top Denver roofers are all BBB A+, this stands out
3. No phone number visible on homepage — potential customers have to dig through a contact form to reach them

**Website assessment:** Broken template — repeated sections, incomplete text, no phone number displayed. Clear quality issues. Offer free website upgrade.

**PRE-LOAD THESE 4 TABS:**
1. Their Google reviews (search "Lotus Roofing Denver CO")
2. Google search: "roofing company Denver" (competitors)
3. Their website: lotusroofingcolorado.com
4. ProFluxLabs website: profluxlabs.netlify.app

**START ON TAB 1 (their Google listing). Hit record.**

> "Hey — Jason from ProFlux Labs. I'm looking at Lotus Roofing out of Denver. You guys have some decent reviews coming in, and the rating looks solid. But here's what I noticed that's probably costing you some business."

**CLICK TO TAB 2 (competitor search).**

> "When I search 'roofing company Denver,' you're up against companies like Formula Roofing with 40 years and hundreds of reviews, Core Roofing with almost 400 reviews. Denver is a competitive market — hailstorm season alone brings out every roofer in the state. The companies that capture the most jobs are the ones with bulletproof follow-up. If someone fills out a form on your site and doesn't hear back in five minutes, they're calling the next company. That's $20K to $30K a month in lost revenue, easy."

**CLICK TO TAB 3 (their website).**

> "And then there's your website — and I want to be real with you here. It needs work. I can see the 'Our Services' header repeating six times, the warranty section says 'comprehensive 10 warranty' with the word 'year' cut off. Little things like this make homeowners click away. If someone's about to spend $15K on a roof, they need to trust the company from the first click. I'd be happy to build you guys a clean, modern site for free — something that actually converts."

**CLICK TO TAB 4 (ProFluxLabs website).**

> "But even bigger than the website — it's the follow-up system. This is ProFlux Labs. We built an AI-powered system that instantly responds to every lead, follows up by text and email, and books appointments automatically. For a growing company like yours, this is how you punch above your weight and compete with the 40-year veterans. Link's below — let's connect. Talk soon."

### 🎬 Roofing Services Now — San Antonio, TX

**Phone:** (210) 988-0188
**Website:** roofingservicesnow.com
**Google:** ~4.8 stars / ~35 reviews (verify before recording)
**BBB:** A+ rated (accredited)
**Email:** (not found — use website contact)
**Years in business:** Since 2016 (~10 years)

**Problems Found:**
1. Despite 10 years in business, only ~35 Google reviews — should have 200+ by now with proper review collection systems
2. Yelp presence is small (18 reviews) — missing a significant discovery channel
3. Website touts "Small Company = Best Attention To Customers" but doesn't have automated follow-up systems — relying on manual response means leads slip through during busy periods

**Website assessment:** Decent website — has content, testimonials, partner logos. Skip free website offer. Go straight to AI follow-up and review generation pitch.

**PRE-LOAD THESE 4 TABS:**
1. Their Google reviews (search "Roofing Services Now San Antonio")
2. Google search: "roofing company San Antonio" (competitors)
3. Their website: roofingservicesnow.com
4. ProFluxLabs website: profluxlabs.netlify.app

**START ON TAB 1 (their Google listing). Hit record.**

> "Hey — Jason from ProFlux Labs. I'm looking at Roofing Services Now in San Antonio. You guys have been around since 2016, you've got solid reviews, good rating. But here's what jumps out at me — after 10 years, you should have way more reviews than this. That tells me you don't have a system in place to automatically collect reviews after every job."

**CLICK TO TAB 2 (competitor search).**

> "Look at the competition — Rhino Roofers, Blue Hammer Roofing, these companies have hundreds of reviews. When a San Antonio homeowner is picking between a company with 35 reviews and one with 500, who do you think wins? Even if your work is better, perception is reality. And beyond reviews, speed matters. Every lead that comes in — if you're on a job and can't call back for two hours, that lead is gone. In this market, that's $20K to $30K a month in lost jobs."

**CLICK TO TAB 3 (their website).**

> "Your website is actually pretty solid — you've got the content, the trust badges, the BBB rating displayed. So I'm not going to tell you you need a new site. What you need is what happens behind the scenes — the engine that captures every lead, responds instantly, follows up automatically, and collects reviews after every completed job."

**CLICK TO TAB 4 (ProFluxLabs website).**

> "That's exactly what ProFlux Labs does. Our AI system handles instant lead response, automated text and email follow-up, appointment booking, and post-job review collection. Imagine going from 35 reviews to 200 in the next year, while also converting more leads into booked jobs — all on autopilot. Link's below to grab a quick demo. Talk soon."

### 🎬 M24 Roofing — Phoenix, AZ

**Phone:** (480) 628-1280
**Website:** m24roofing.com
**Google:** ~5.0 stars / ~15 reviews (verify before recording)
**BBB:** Accredited since 9/2023
**Email:** (not found — use website contact)
**Years in business:** Since 2008 (~18 years)

**Problems Found:**
1. Website is a basic Wix template — generic stock photos, no project portfolio, looks like a small-time operation despite 18 years of experience
2. Only ~15 Google reviews after 18 years in business — massive missed opportunity for social proof
3. No Yelp presence, no visible email, no online booking — potential customers have limited ways to engage

**Website assessment:** Basic Wix template site — functional but generic. Doesn't reflect 18 years of experience. Offer free website upgrade.

**PRE-LOAD THESE 4 TABS:**
1. Their Google reviews (search "M24 Roofing Phoenix AZ")
2. Google search: "roofing company Phoenix" (competitors)
3. Their website: m24roofing.com
4. ProFluxLabs website: profluxlabs.netlify.app

**START ON TAB 1 (their Google listing). Hit record.**

> "Hey — Jason from ProFlux Labs. I'm looking at M24 Roofing in Phoenix. You've been in business since 2008, which is almost 18 years — that's serious experience. And your reviews are five stars, which is great. But here's the problem — you only have about 15 of them. After nearly two decades, that number should be in the hundreds."

**CLICK TO TAB 2 (competitor search).**

> "When someone in Phoenix searches for a roofer, they see companies like Rob's Roofing, Stonecreek, RENCO — all with way more reviews and visibility. Your five-star rating means nothing if nobody sees it. And the leads that do find you — if you're on a roof and miss a call, and they don't hear back for two hours? They've already booked with someone else. In Phoenix, that's easily $20K to $30K a month in lost revenue."

**CLICK TO TAB 3 (their website).**

> "And your website — I know you've got 18 years of experience, but this site doesn't show it. It's a basic Wix template with stock photos. No project gallery, no before-and-afters, no customer testimonials on the page. When a homeowner is deciding who to trust with a $15K roof replacement, first impressions matter. I'd be happy to build you a proper site for free — something that actually reflects the quality of work you do."

**CLICK TO TAB 4 (ProFluxLabs website).**

> "But the bigger win is this — ProFlux Labs. We built an AI follow-up system that responds to every lead instantly, follows up by text and email, books appointments, and even helps collect reviews automatically.

### 🎬 A Mountain Roofing — Tucson, AZ

**Phone:** (520) 433-2085
**Website:** (no dedicated website found — uses Yelp/BBB/Angi profiles)
**Google:** ~4.5 stars / ~20 reviews (verify before recording)
**BBB:** Accredited
**Email:** (not found)
**Years in business:** ~5+ years

**Problems Found:**
1. No website — this is the single biggest red flag for a roofing company. Homeowners who can't find a website will choose a competitor who has one
2. Limited Google reviews — relying entirely on word-of-mouth and directory listings
3. No way for customers to book online, see past work, or learn about services — everything depends on a phone call

**Website assessment:** NO WEBSITE. Absolutely offer free website — this is the strongest pitch in the batch.

**PRE-LOAD THESE 4 TABS:**
1. Their Google reviews (search "A Mountain Roofing Tucson AZ")
2. Google search: "roofing company Tucson" (competitors)
3. Their BBB page: bbb.org/us/az/tucson/profile/roofing-contractors/a-mountain-roofing-llc-1286-20093993 (since no website)
4. ProFluxLabs website: profluxlabs.netlify.app

**START ON TAB 1 (their Google listing). Hit record.**

> "Hey — Jason from ProFlux Labs. I'm looking at A Mountain Roofing in Tucson right now. You guys have solid reviews, people clearly like your work — Jorge and the team get mentioned by name, which is always a good sign. But there's something holding you back in a big way."

**CLICK TO TAB 2 (competitor search).**

> "When I search 'roofing company Tucson,' you've got AA Brite, Blue Mountain Roofing, Desert Sky — all with established websites, tons of reviews, strong online presence. You're competing with companies that are fully set up online while you're essentially invisible to anyone who doesn't already know your name. And in 2026, that's a huge problem. Most homeowners search Google before they call anyone. If you don't have a website, you don't exist to half your potential customers. That's $20K to $30K a month in jobs you never even know about."

**CLICK TO TAB 3 (their BBB page).**

> "Right now, the best someone can find is your BBB page or your Yelp listing. That's it. No website, no portfolio, no way to book online. I want to change that for you — I'd build you guys a full, modern roofing website for free. Professional photos section, service pages, reviews, online booking — the whole thing. No catch, I just want to show you what's possible."

Hey Jorge and team,

Jason here from ProFlux Labs. I recorded a quick 90-second video audit of your online presence — and the biggest thing I found is that you don't have a website.

Your reviews are solid, people clearly love your work. But without a website, you're invisible to a huge chunk of potential customers searching for roofers in Tucson.

I'd like to build you a full, modern roofing website — for free. Professional design, service pages, reviews section, online booking. No strings attached.

**Recording order suggestion (strongest pitches first):**
1. A Mountain Roofing (Tucson) — no website = strongest offer
2. El Paso Roofing Co (El Paso) — outdated site + not BBB = lots of ammunition
3. Lotus Roofing (Denver) — broken website = visible problems to point at
4. M24 Roofing (Phoenix) — 18 years, 15 reviews = strong disconnect angle
5. Valley Roofing & Repair (Phoenix) — new company growth angle
6. Roofing Services Now (San Antonio) — 10 years, should have more reviews
7. C&M Roofing (Houston) — new company in massive market angle
