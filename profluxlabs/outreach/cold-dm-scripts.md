# Cold DM Scripts — Facebook & Instagram

> 3 variations for reaching roofers via social DMs. Keep it casual — you're in their personal space.

## Variation 1: The Compliment + Question

> Best for: Roofers who are active on social, posting job photos

**Message:**

Hey {{FirstName}}! Saw your recent roof job on {{Platform}} — that looks clean. Quick question for you:

Do you ever miss calls while you're up on a roof? Most roofers I talk to say they lose 5-10 calls a week during jobs.

We set up a system that auto-texts missed callers back instantly and captures their info so you don't lose the lead. One saved call could be a $10K+ job.

Would you be open to seeing how it works? Takes like 10 min.

## Variation 2: The Direct Approach

> Best for: Bigger operations, roofers who run ads, clearly growth-minded

**Message:**

Hey {{FirstName}} — I help roofing companies capture more leads without hiring more people.

Quick version: when someone calls and you can't answer, our AI texts them back in seconds, books the appointment, and follows up automatically.

Most roofers are losing $5-15K/month in jobs from missed calls alone. We fix that.

Worth a quick chat? I can show you exactly how it works for roofers in {{City}}.

## Variation 3: The Peer Reference

> Best for: When you have any social proof (even one client/case study)

**Message:**

Hey {{FirstName}}! I work with a few roofing companies on their lead follow-up — one of them was missing 30+ calls a month and didn't even realize it.

We set up an AI system that texts back every missed call instantly, captures the lead, and books estimates automatically. They picked up an extra $12K in jobs the first month just from leads they would've lost.

I think it'd work well for {{CompanyName}}. Want me to send over a quick breakdown of how it works?

## DM Tips

- **Don't send at night.** Weekday mornings or lunch breaks work best.
- **Follow their page first** and engage with a post or two before DMing (like/comment).
- **If no reply after 3-5 days**, send ONE follow-up: "Hey {{FirstName}}, just bumping this up — no pressure either way 👊"
- **Never send the same script twice.** If V1 doesn't land, try V2 as a follow-up angle.
- **Facebook > Instagram** for roofers. Most are more active in FB groups and on their business pages.
