## 1. FT Construction & Roofing
**Las Vegas, NV**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | (702) 889-1688 |
| Website | None found (no website listed) |
| Google Rating | ~3.8 stars / 8 reviews |
| Yelp | Unclaimed listing |

### Problems Found
1. **Only 8 reviews on Google** — in a city the size of Vegas, competitors have 100+. They're invisible in local search.
2. **Yelp listing is unclaimed** — anyone can say anything and they can't respond. No photos, no business description.
3. **No website** — Yellow Pages and Manta list them but there's no actual company website. Customers searching online will skip right past them.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey, what's up — this is Jason. I'm recording this specifically for the team over at FT Construction & Roofing in Las Vegas.
>
> So I was looking at your online presence and I found a few things that are probably costing you jobs right now. First off — you only have 8 Google reviews. Your competitors in Vegas have over a hundred. When someone searches 'roofing company Las Vegas,' you're basically not showing up.
>
> Second, your Yelp listing is unclaimed. That means you can't respond to reviews, you can't add photos, nothing. It's just sitting there.
>
> And third — I couldn't find a website for you guys at all. In 2026, if someone can't find you online in 30 seconds, they're calling the next company. And when we're talking about roofing jobs that run $8–15K each… every missed call is real money walking out the door.
>
> I actually built something that helps roofing companies like yours capture and follow up with every single lead automatically — so you never lose a job to a competitor just because you couldn't get back to someone fast enough. I'd love to show you how it works. There's a link below to book a quick 15-minute demo — no pressure, no sales pitch, just a walkthrough. Talk soon."

## 2. Eco Roofing Solutions LLC
**Gilbert / Phoenix, AZ**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | (951) 837-3914 |
| Website | ecoroofaz.com |
| Angi Rating | 1.0 stars |
| BBB | Complaints filed — including ROC (state contractor board) involvement |

### Problems Found
1. **1.0 star rating on Angi** — with a detailed complaint about shoddy work and being reported to Arizona's Registrar of Contractors.
2. **BBB complaints** — customer reported Eco invoiced $2,650 for incomplete work, then unilaterally voided the contract and cut off communication.
3. **Reddit & HomeAdvisor warnings** — multiple people publicly saying "DO NOT HIRE ECO ROOFING SOLUTIONS" with detailed horror stories about them demanding customers withdraw ROC complaints before finishing repairs.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey — Jason here. I put this together specifically for Eco Roofing Solutions out in the Phoenix area.
>
> So here's the deal — I was doing some research on your online reputation and honestly, there are some red flags that are almost certainly costing you business. You've got a 1-star rating on Angi right now, and there are BBB complaints where customers are saying you took their money, didn't finish the work, and then stopped responding.
>
> There's even a thread on Reddit where someone is telling people not to hire you because of issues with the state contractor board. Now look — I'm not here to judge. I don't know your side of the story. But here's what I do know: when a homeowner Googles your name before calling, this is what they're seeing. And that means you're losing jobs before you even get a chance to bid.
>
> We built a system that helps roofing companies manage their reputation, respond to every lead instantly, and make sure no customer falls through the cracks. If you're open to it, I'd love to do a quick 15-minute walkthrough — link is below.
>
> Even if you don't work with us, you should know what people are saying about you online. Talk soon."

## 3. South Texas Roofing
**San Antonio, TX**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | Not publicly listed (operates via Angi/HomeAdvisor) |
| Website | None found |
| Angi Rating | 3.9 stars |
| BBB | Not accredited |

### Problems Found
1. **Customer complaint about taking a deposit and ghosting** — Angi review says they signed a contract with a start date, paid a down payment, then the owner "has not returned our phone calls or texts, nor done any of the work."
2. **No website** — no way for customers to find them independently. Entirely dependent on lead-gen platforms.
3. **Not BBB accredited** — no established trust signals. No Google Business Profile readily found.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey, this is Jason — I'm reaching out specifically to South Texas Roofing in San Antonio.
>
> I was looking into your business online and there are a couple things I wanted to flag for you. First, you've got a review on Angi where a customer says they paid a deposit, had a start date set, and then couldn't get a call or text back. That one review alone could be scaring off dozens of potential customers.
>
> Second, I couldn't find a website for you guys anywhere. No Google Business Profile that's easy to find, no BBB listing. So if someone in San Antonio needs a roof and Googles 'roofing company near me' — you don't exist to them.
>
> Here's why that matters: the average roofing job in Texas is $8 to $12K. If you're losing even two or three jobs a month because people can't find you or they see that review and call someone else — that's $20–30K in lost revenue.
>
> We help roofing companies fix exactly this. Automated follow-ups so no lead gets ghosted, reputation management, the whole thing. I'd love to show you — it's a 15-minute demo, link's below. No pressure."

## 4. NTX Roof Tech
**Dallas, TX**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | Listed via BBB (Dallas, TX) |
| Website | ntxsolarandconstruction.com |
| BBB | Not accredited — multiple complaints |
| Google | Limited reviews on BuildZoom/Houzz |

### Problems Found
1. **Multiple BBB complaints about not returning calls** — one customer says "no one would ever show up on the dates they gave" and they "did not answer phone calls or return messages" after receiving payment.
2. **Another BBB complaint** about taking money for windows/roof work and never completing it, then going silent.
3. **Minimal online reviews** — BuildZoom says "hasn't received any reviews." Very thin Google presence for a DFW-area contractor.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "What's up — Jason here. I made this for the team at NTX Roof Tech in Dallas.
>
> So I pulled up your online profiles and I want to be straight with you — there are some things showing up that are probably hurting your business more than you realize. You've got complaints on the BBB where customers are saying they paid for work that never got finished, and that phone calls and messages went unanswered.
>
> On top of that, your review presence is really thin. BuildZoom says zero reviews. When you're competing against Dallas roofers who have hundreds of 5-star Google reviews, that's a tough spot to be in.
>
> The thing is — a lot of this comes down to follow-up. Most roofing companies lose leads not because the work is bad, but because the response time is too slow or the follow-up drops off. We built an AI system that handles all of that automatically — every call gets answered, every lead gets followed up with, and your customers actually hear back from you.
>
> If you want to see how it works, I've got a link below for a quick 15-minute demo. Worth a look."

## 5. Braun's Roofing
**Houston, TX**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | (713) 645-0505 |
| Website | brauns-roofing.com |
| Google Rating | 4.1 stars / 235 reviews |
| Status | Possibly closed (MapQuest lists as "CLOSED") |

### Problems Found
1. **4.1 star rating with 235 reviews** — in Houston's competitive market, competitors are at 4.8–4.9. That gap is killing their search ranking.
2. **Negative reviews mention mismatched shingles, price gouging** — one says "Horrible experience. Bad job, shingles were not matched, gouged us for another $1,000."
3. **Possibly closed or reduced operations** — MapQuest listing shows "CLOSED." If they're still operating, their online presence suggests otherwise.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey — Jason here, reaching out to Braun's Roofing in Houston.
>
> I was looking at your Google profile and a few things jumped out. You're at a 4.1 rating right now with about 235 reviews. Now, that's not terrible — but in Houston, your competitors are sitting at 4.8, 4.9 with 400+ reviews. Google's algorithm pushes those companies to the top, and you end up lower in the map pack.
>
> I also saw some reviews that mention mismatched shingles and unexpected charges. Those specific complaints are the kind of thing that makes a homeowner scroll right past you. And when the average roof replacement in Houston is running $10–15K, even losing one job a week to bad positioning online is costing you serious money.
>
> We help roofing companies turn this around — automated follow-ups with every lead, smart review collection to push your rating back up, and an AI assistant that makes sure no call goes unanswered. If you're open to it, I'd love to give you a 15-minute walkthrough. Link is right below this video."

## 6. Arizona Roofers LLC
**Phoenix, AZ**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | Listed via BBB |
| Website | Not readily found |
| BBB | Not accredited — negative review about leaking roof |
| Google | Limited presence |

### Problems Found
1. **BBB review says "Very disappointed — roof has leaked more than ever after the very first rainfall"** — devastating review for a roofing company. This is the first thing people see when they search the business name.
2. **Not BBB accredited** and no apparent response to the complaint.
3. **No easily findable website or robust Google listing** — hard to find online, and when you do find them, the first result is the BBB complaint.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey, this is Jason. I put this quick video together for Arizona Roofers LLC in Phoenix.
>
> I looked you up online and the first thing that came up was a BBB review where a customer says their roof leaked worse after you redid it. Now, I don't know if that was resolved, but the problem is — that's what every potential customer sees when they Google your name.
>
> On top of that, I couldn't find a website for you, and your Google presence is pretty minimal. In a market like Phoenix where there's a ton of competition, that combination — thin online presence plus a negative review sitting right at the top — is like a one-two punch to your lead flow.
>
> The fix for this isn't complicated. You need a way to generate more positive reviews to bury that one, and you need a system that responds to every lead instantly so people don't move on to the next roofer. That's exactly what we built.
>
> I've got a link below for a 15-minute demo — I think it'd be worth your time. Talk soon."

## 7. Colonial Roofing Company
**Dallas, TX**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | (214) 634-0805 |
| Website | colonialroofingtx.com |
| BBB | Not accredited |
| Yelp | Listed — 3202 Hammerly Dr, Dallas |

### Problems Found
1. **Not BBB accredited** despite being in a major metro — a trust signal that's missing when customers compare them to accredited competitors.
2. **Minimal online reviews** — no significant Google review volume visible. In the DFW market where top companies have 500+ reviews, this is a major disadvantage.
3. **Yelp listing appears underutilized** — no evidence of active management, photo uploads, or review responses.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey — Jason here, recording this for Colonial Roofing in Dallas.
>
> So I was checking out your online presence and here's what I noticed. You've got a website, which is good — but your review game is really thin. In the Dallas market, the companies showing up at the top of Google Maps have 500, 1,000+ reviews. Without that social proof, you're not going to show up when homeowners search for roofers.
>
> You're also not accredited with the BBB, and your Yelp listing doesn't look like it's being actively managed. These are all signals that Google and potential customers use to decide who to call first.
>
> Here's the thing — you don't need to hire a marketing agency to fix this. You just need a system that automatically follows up with every customer, asks for reviews at the right time, and makes sure you never miss a lead. That's literally what we built.
>
> I've got a quick 15-minute demo linked below — worth checking out if you're looking to get more jobs without spending more on ads."

## 8. Phoenix Roofing Contractors Inc
**Phoenix, AZ**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | Listed via BBB |
| Website | Not readily found |
| BBB | Not accredited |
| Google | Minimal presence |

### Problems Found
1. **Not BBB accredited** — in a market where many competitors are A+ rated, this stands out.
2. **No discernible website** — searching the company name returns mostly BBB and directory listings, not an owned web property.
3. **Very low online visibility** — no meaningful review profile on Google, Yelp, or Angi. Effectively invisible to homeowners searching online.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey, this is Jason — reaching out to Phoenix Roofing Contractors.
>
> I did a quick audit of your online presence and I'll be honest — it's hard to find you. When I Google your name, there's no website, no strong Google Business Profile, no real review presence. In a market like Phoenix where there are dozens of roofing companies competing for the same homeowners, that's a problem.
>
> Most homeowners in 2026 are making their decision based on what they find in the first 60 seconds of searching. If they can't find your reviews, your photos, your website — they're calling the company that does have all that.
>
> We built a system that helps contractors like you capture every incoming lead, respond instantly, and start building the kind of online presence that actually generates business. It takes about 15 minutes for me to walk you through it — link's below if you're interested."

## 9. A & B Sheet Metal and Roofing
**Taylor, TX (near Austin)**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | Listed via Angi |
| Website | Not easily found |
| Angi | Complaint about unfinished work and no callback |

### Problems Found
1. **Angi review says "they said they would return to do additional work — they've never called back."** Classic callback issue that ProFlux solves directly.
2. **Thin online presence** — not a company that shows up easily in online search. Mostly found through directory listings.
3. **No proactive review management** — the negative callback review sits unanswered and unaddressed.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "What's up — Jason here. This one's for A & B Sheet Metal and Roofing out in Taylor, Texas.
>
> I came across a review about your company that honestly tells the whole story of why I'm reaching out. A customer says you did some work on their roof, said you'd come back to finish additional repairs — and then never called back. That review is now sitting on Angi for everyone to see.
>
> And look, I'm not trying to call you out. I know how it goes — you're busy, you've got crews running, and follow-ups just slip through the cracks. But that one missed callback could easily represent a $10–15K roof replacement that went to someone else. And worse, it's now a public review that's scaring off future customers.
>
> This is the exact problem we solve. Our AI system tracks every lead, every follow-up, and makes sure nothing falls through the cracks. No more 'I'll call them back tomorrow' that turns into never.
>
> I'd love to show you how it works — 15-minute demo, link below. I think you'll see the value right away."

## 10. South Texas Roofing & Renovations LLC
**San Antonio, TX**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Phone | Not publicly listed |
| Website | None found |
| BBB | Not accredited — separate entity from "South Texas Roofing" above |
| Google | Very limited presence |

### Problems Found
1. **Not BBB accredited** and essentially zero web presence — no website, no meaningful review profiles.
2. **No Google Business Profile optimization** — difficult to find through any standard search.
3. **Operating in San Antonio's competitive roofing market with no digital footprint** — completely reliant on word-of-mouth or door-knocking while competitors dominate online.

### 🎬 Loom Script
> "Hey — Jason here. I put this together for South Texas Roofing & Renovations in San Antonio.
>
> I spent some time looking for you guys online and honestly — I couldn't find much. No website, no active Google Business listing, no BBB profile. In a city like San Antonio where there are hundreds of roofing companies, that basically means you don't exist to the majority of homeowners looking for help.
>
> Here's the reality: 87% of homeowners start their search for a contractor online. If they can't find you, they can't hire you. And every one of those missed opportunities is a $5 to $15K roofing job going to someone else.
>
> We help roofing companies get found, respond to every lead automatically, and build a review presence that keeps the phone ringing. I'd love to walk you through it — takes 15 minutes, and I think you'll see how it could change your business. Link's below."

## Tips for Recording
- Pull up their Google Business Profile on screen as you talk
