## FAQ

**Why is there a setup fee?**
We custom-build your system — your branding, your workflows, your integrations. The setup fee covers the build. After that, the monthly covers hosting, AI usage, support, and optimization.

**What if it doesn't work?**
If you don't see ROI within 90 days, you can cancel. No hard feelings. But in our experience, the math speaks for itself — one saved lead covers months of service.

**Can I upgrade later?**
Absolutely. Most clients start at Starter or Pro and upgrade once they see the results. We'll migrate everything seamlessly.
