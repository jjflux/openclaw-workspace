## JASON'S 4 VIDEOS

### Video 1: "Her Cold Email Strategy Has a 43% OPEN RATE!"
- **Channel:** Apollo.io (featuring Sam McKenna of #samsales Consulting)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydsMxs2yeos
- **Published:** Oct 2024

#### Key Strategies — The "Show Me You Know Me" (SMYKM) Method:
1. **Subject lines that only make sense to the recipient** — Reference personal details (fraternity, hometown, hobbies) combined with professional relevance. Formula: `[Personal Reference] + [Professional Relevance] + [Your Company]`
2. **Preview text / opening line matters enormously** — Either use a formal intro ("We have yet to be properly introduced...") or reference something personal from their social media
3. **Focus on the PROBLEM you solve, not features** — State the specific problem, then preemptively address the #1 objection
4. **CTAs that don't suck** — Soft asks, not hard pitches. "Would it be worth a conversation?" beats "Book a call now"
5. **Results:** 43% open rate, 20% reply rate vs. industry avg of 6% open, 0.9% reply

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **AGREE:** Deep personalization is key. For roofers, we should reference specific things about their business (recent jobs on their Facebook, Google review themes, their specific service area)
- **DISAGREE (partially):** Sam's method is designed for enterprise/executive sales. Roofers won't have fraternities on LinkedIn. We need a blue-collar version of SMYKM
- **ADAPT:** Our version = "I saw your [specific Google review / Facebook post / website issue]" — this IS "show me you know me" for contractors

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ Reference a specific Google review or recent job post in email subject lines
- ✅ Subject line format for roofers: `[Their City] + roofing leads + [Our Name]` or reference a specific review
- ✅ Soft CTAs — "Mind if I send over a quick video showing what I found?" (we're already doing this!)
- ✅ Preemptively handle the "I don't need marketing" objection in the email body

### Video 2: "FREE COURSE: How To Book 1-3+ Sales Calls/day With Cold SMS"
- **Channel:** Unknown (Skool community-based creator)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIyCvQ-y1mQ
- **Published:** Nov 2025

#### Key Strategies:
1. **Cold SMS as a primary outreach channel** — Not just a supplement, but a lead channel that can book 1-3+ calls/day
2. **Short, conversational texts** — SMS should feel like a friend texting, not a marketing message. No links in first text.
3. **Two-step SMS approach:** First text = pattern interrupt / question. Second text (if reply) = value prop + CTA
4. **Volume matters** — Need to send enough texts to hit statistical significance. Track reply rates obsessively.
5. **Compliance:** Use proper opt-out language, A2P 10DLC registration, don't spam

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **STRONGLY AGREE:** SMS is our secret weapon for roofers. These guys live on their phones — they're on job sites, not checking email. Text is the #1 way to reach a contractor.
- **AGREE:** Conversational tone is critical. Roofers will ignore anything that smells like marketing.
- **CAUTION:** Need to be careful with compliance (TCPA). Use registered numbers through GHL.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ SMS should be our FIRST touch, not last — roofers check texts before email
- ✅ First text example: "Hey [Name], I was looking at [Company]'s Google reviews — you guys do great work. Quick question — are you taking on new jobs right now or are you booked out?"
- ✅ Keep texts under 160 characters when possible
- ✅ Follow up non-responders with a different angle 2-3 days later
- ✅ Register for A2P 10DLC through GHL to avoid carrier filtering

### Video 3: "I tried sending 50,000 cold emails in a week (RAW RESULTS)"
- **Channel:** GrowthFlare (Aaron Shepherd)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZtkfPDsU88
- **Published:** Oct 2025

#### Key Strategies:
1. **Mass cold email at scale** — 50K emails/week using tools like Instantly, Clay for enrichment, Mailr for sending infrastructure
2. **Infrastructure is everything** — Multiple domains, warmed-up inboxes, proper DNS (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
3. **Personalization at scale with Clay** — Use data enrichment to auto-personalize first lines based on company data
4. **The numbers game:** At scale, even low reply rates (1-3%) generate significant deal flow
5. **Split test everything** — Subject lines, body copy, CTAs, sending times
6. **Dedicated sending domains** — Never use your main domain for cold email. Buy separate domains.

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **PARTIALLY DISAGREE:** This is a volume play. We're a 2-person operation targeting a niche (roofers in specific metros). We don't need 50K emails. We need 500 highly targeted emails with strong personalization.
- **AGREE on infrastructure:** We absolutely need proper email setup — separate domains, warm-up, DNS records. This is non-negotiable.
- **AGREE on split testing:** Even at our scale, A/B testing subject lines matters.
- **KEY INSIGHT:** Aaron's approach works for lead gen agencies selling to other agencies. Roofers need a more personal touch.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ Buy 2-3 cold email domains (e.g., profluxlabs.co, profluxlabs.io) and warm them up for 2-3 weeks
- ✅ Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC on all sending domains
- ✅ Use Instantly or similar for email sequences (not GHL for cold email — deliverability is better with dedicated tools)
- ✅ Keep volume reasonable: 50-100 emails/day per domain, not thousands
- ✅ Use Clay or similar to enrich roofer data (revenue, review count, website tech stack)

### Video 4: "$25m Agency Owner Leaks His Cold Outreach System (FULL Live Mastermind and Q&A)"
- **Channel:** Agency Club (likely Serge Gatari or similar $25M agency owner)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzfDlbzYweQ
- **Published:** Dec 2025

#### Key Strategies:
1. **Multi-channel outreach is non-negotiable** — Email + cold call + SMS + social DM. Hit prospects on every channel.
2. **GoHighLevel as the CRM/automation backbone** — Centralize all outreach, follow-ups, and pipeline management
3. **Cold email → cold call combo** — Send email first, then call referencing the email. "Hey, I sent you an email about X, did you get a chance to look at it?"
4. **META ads toolkit for agency clients** — Proving ROI through ad results
5. **Speed to lead** — When someone replies, respond within 5 minutes. Speed kills in sales.
6. **The "accelerator" model** — Systematize your outreach so it's repeatable, not random

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **STRONGLY AGREE:** Multi-channel is exactly what we're doing (text + email + calls). This validates our approach.
- **AGREE:** GHL is the right backbone. We need to fully build out our GHL workflows.
- **AGREE:** Speed to lead is critical. When a roofer replies to our text, we need to respond FAST — these guys make decisions quickly and move on.
- **KEY INSIGHT:** The email-then-call combo is powerful. Most people just do one or the other.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ Build a sequenced workflow in GHL: Day 1 = SMS, Day 2 = Email, Day 3 = Cold Call referencing email, Day 5 = Follow-up SMS, Day 7 = Loom video (for warm leads only)
- ✅ Set up instant notifications for replies — respond within 5 minutes
- ✅ On cold calls, reference the previous touchpoints: "Hey [Name], this is Jason from ProFluxLabs — I texted you a couple days ago about your Google reviews..."
- ✅ Track everything in GHL pipeline — know exactly where each roofer is in the sequence

## ADDITIONAL VIDEOS

### Video 5: "Steal This Cold Outreach Strategy & Make $9K/Month Selling AI"
- **Channel:** Maker School
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE6VcwCBSqA
- **Published:** Jul 2025

#### Key Strategies:
1. **AI automation specifically** — Selling AI/automation services to local businesses at ~$3K/mo (or $9K with 3 clients)
2. **Lead with a demo, not a pitch** — Build a quick demo of what their AI chatbot/automation would look like BEFORE reaching out
3. **Skool community for templates and support** — Leverage community knowledge for outreach scripts
4. **Position as a "partner" not a "vendor"** — Frame it as "I built something for you" vs "I sell a service"

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **AGREE on the demo-first approach** — This aligns with our Loom video strategy. Showing > telling.
- **DISAGREE on pricing** — $3K/mo is too high for most roofers starting out. Our $997-1500 range is smarter for getting initial clients. Can upsell later.
- **AGREE on partner positioning** — Roofers hate feeling "sold to." We need to be their "tech guy" not a salesperson.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ In Loom videos, show an actual MOCKUP of what their AI receptionist would sound like or what their automated follow-up would look like
- ✅ Frame messaging as "I built this for [Company Name]" not "I sell AI automation"
- ✅ Consider building a generic demo chatbot that we can quickly customize with each roofer's info before outreach

### Video 6: "The BEST Loom Outreach Strategy for your AI Agency in 2026"
- **Channel:** Unknown AI Agency Creator
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hODuoYgc9O0
- **Published:** Jan 2026

#### Key Strategies:
1. **Loom + n8n workflow automation** — Automate the research phase before recording Looms (pull Google reviews, website data, social media automatically)
2. **AI agency-specific Loom structure:** Open with their name + company, show their website/Google listing, identify 2-3 specific problems, briefly show how AI solves each one, end with soft CTA
3. **Keep Looms under 3 minutes** — Shorter = higher watch completion rate
4. **Use n8n to auto-generate a "prospect brief"** so you can record Looms faster with pre-pulled data

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **STRONGLY AGREE:** This is exactly our model but more systematized. We need to automate the research step.
- **AGREE on 3-minute max** — Our Looms might be too long. Need to trim to the essentials.
- **KEY INSIGHT:** Using n8n to auto-pull prospect data before recording is a massive time-saver. We could build this.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ Build an n8n workflow: Input roofer name/URL → auto-pull Google reviews, website screenshots, Facebook presence, review count → output a "prospect brief" card
- ✅ Standardize our Loom structure: (1) "Hey [Name]" + quick context, (2) Show their Google listing + 2 specific issues, (3) Quick AI solution demo, (4) "Want to hop on a quick call?"
- ✅ Cap Looms at 2-3 minutes. Anything longer loses them.
- ✅ Batch Loom recording — do 5-10 in a session using pre-pulled briefs

### Video 7: "Best SMMA Cold Outreach Methods for 2025 (Working)"
- **Channel:** Jordan Platten (Affluent Academy)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ssfqu-CApo
- **Published:** Apr 2024

#### Key Strategies:
1. **Tier your outreach methods by effort vs. reward:**
   - Tier 1 (Low effort): Cold DMs on Instagram/Facebook
   - Tier 2 (Medium): Cold email sequences
   - Tier 3 (High effort, high reward): Loom videos
   - Tier 4 (Highest): Cold calling
2. **Loom videos have the highest close rate** but are time-intensive — use them strategically
3. **Cold calling still works** in 2025 — most agencies won't do it because it's uncomfortable, which means less competition
4. **Free Miro board** with full outreach system mapped out
5. **Personalization hierarchy:** The more personal the touchpoint, the higher the conversion

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **STRONGLY AGREE on the tier system** — We're doing Tier 2 + 3 + 4. This is the right combo.
- **AGREE that cold calling is underrated** — Especially for roofers. These guys respect directness and phone calls. Other agencies are hiding behind emails.
- **AGREE that Loom has highest close rate** — Our Trojan Horse method (only recording for warm replies) is the smart way to get Loom's benefits without wasting time

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ Don't abandon cold calling — it's our differentiator. Most AI agencies won't pick up the phone.
- ✅ Add social DMs as a supplementary channel (Facebook for roofers — they're all on Facebook, not Instagram)
- ✅ Follow Jordan's personalization hierarchy: More personal = more conversions. Our multi-channel approach stacks these.

### Video 8: "The Best Loom Cold Email Strategy in 2024"
- **Channel:** Instantly.ai (likely featuring their team/partners)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOBMetFx1n4
- **Published:** Sep 2024

#### Key Strategies (cross-referenced with ListKit's Trojan Horse article):
1. **The Trojan Horse method (exactly what we're doing):**
   - Step 1: Send cold email with soft CTA — "Mind if I share a quick video?"
   - Step 2: Only record Loom for people who reply "yes"
   - Step 3: Send Loom with embedded thumbnail + timestamps + clear next step
2. **Embed the thumbnail in the follow-up email** — Tell them to CLICK THE THUMBNAIL (people miss this)
3. **Include timestamps** in the email: "Check out 1:20 to see X and 4:15 to hear about Y"
4. **Set up an automated subsequence** for non-responders after the Loom is sent
5. **Triple-verify leads** to avoid bounces — use tools like ListKit for verified B2B contacts

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **THIS IS OUR EXACT STRATEGY.** This video validates everything we're doing.
- **We can improve:** We may not be including timestamps or telling people to click the thumbnail explicitly enough.
- **We can improve:** We need a follow-up sequence AFTER the Loom is sent, not just before.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ When sending Loom follow-ups, ALWAYS include: thumbnail image, timestamps for key moments, and explicit "click the image to watch" instruction
- ✅ Build a post-Loom follow-up sequence: Day 1 = Loom sent, Day 3 = "Did you get a chance to watch?", Day 5 = "The offer in that video won't be available forever" (urgency), Day 7 = Final follow-up or cold call
- ✅ Template: "Hey [Name], here's the custom video I made for [Company]. Click the thumbnail below. Check out the 1:15 mark — that's where I show [specific thing]. How does [Day] at [Time] work for a quick call?"

### Video 9: "NEW AI Cold Outreach Methods to Get Clients Fast (2026)"
- **Channel:** Affluent Academy (Jordan Platten's team)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcOTcUoAaPg
- **Published:** Feb 2025

#### Key Strategies:
1. **AI-powered personalization at scale** — Use AI to research prospects and write personalized first lines automatically
2. **Multi-channel sequences are now table stakes** — Email alone won't cut it in 2026
3. **"Guarantee" framing** — "Get your next 10 clients, guaranteed" — confidence in your offer makes outreach easier
4. **Focus on RESULTS, not services** — Don't say "we do AI automation." Say "we help roofers get 20+ new leads per month without spending on ads"
5. **Speed of implementation** — Clients want results fast. Position your service as quick to deploy.

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **STRONGLY AGREE on results-based framing** — Roofers don't care about "AI." They care about "more jobs" and "less missed calls." We need to strip all tech jargon from our outreach.
- **AGREE on speed** — "Set up in 48 hours" or "See results in your first week" — roofers want immediate impact.
- **AGREE on guarantee framing** — At $997/mo, we could potentially offer a "results or your money back" guarantee to reduce risk.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ Rewrite ALL outreach copy to focus on outcomes: "Never miss another roofing lead" / "Get 15-20 more calls per month" / "Your phone rings, guaranteed"
- ✅ Strip out ALL tech jargon — no "AI," no "automation," no "workflows." Just results.
- ✅ Consider a satisfaction guarantee for first month — reduces friction enormously
- ✅ Add "set up in 48 hours" or "live by Friday" to our pitch — urgency + speed

### Video 10: "The BEST Loom Cold Email Outreach Strategy To Get Clients (Full Guide)"
- **Channel:** Cold Email Mastery (CB Writes Copy)
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEkkd5dItes
- **Published:** May 2023

#### Key Strategies:
1. **Full walkthrough of the Trojan Horse Loom strategy** — Similar to Video 8 but with more detail on the initial cold email
2. **The initial email should identify a REAL problem** — Don't fake it. Actually look at their website/marketing and find something wrong.
3. **Position as a "customer" or "interested party"** in the first email — "I was checking out your website and noticed..."
4. **Don't pitch in the Loom** — Only provide value. Save the pitch for the call.
5. **Cold Email Mastery course** — Framework for scaling this approach

#### ProFluxLabs Assessment:
- **AGREE on finding real problems** — This is critical for roofers. Common issues: no Google Business optimization, slow website, no review response, missed calls going to voicemail, no follow-up system
- **AGREE on not pitching in the Loom** — Pure value. The call is where we close.
- **AGREE on positioning as interested party** — "I was looking for a roofer in [City] and found your listing..." is a great opener

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- ✅ Create a "roofer audit checklist" — 10 things we check for every prospect: Google Business completeness, review count & recency, website speed, mobile-friendliness, call tracking, follow-up automation, social media presence, online booking capability, review responses, competitor comparison
- ✅ Opening email angle: "I was looking at roofing companies in [City] and came across [Company]. Noticed a couple things that might be costing you leads..."
- ✅ In Loom: ONLY show problems and how to fix them. Never mention pricing or packages.

## KEY CONTRADICTIONS & OUR POSITION {#contradictions}

### 1. Volume vs. Quality
- **Volume camp** (Video 3 — GrowthFlare): Send 50K emails, play the numbers
- **Quality camp** (Videos 1, 6, 8, 10): Deep personalization, fewer emails, higher conversion
- **🎯 OUR POSITION: Quality wins for roofers.** These are not SaaS founders checking email all day. They're on roofs. We need every touchpoint to feel personal and relevant. 200-500 highly targeted outreaches per month > 50K spray-and-pray.

### 2. Lead with Loom vs. Lead with Text Hook
- **Loom-first camp** (Video 7 Tier 3): Record Loom as the initial outreach
- **Hook-first camp** (Videos 8, 10 — Trojan Horse): Text/email hook first, Loom only for warm replies
- **🎯 OUR POSITION: Trojan Horse is correct.** Recording Looms for cold prospects is a massive time waste. Our approach of qualifying interest first, then investing time in a Loom, is the only scalable way.

### 3. Email vs. SMS vs. Cold Call as Primary Channel
- **Email-first** (Videos 1, 3, 8): Email is the primary channel
- **SMS-first** (Video 2): Text messages as the lead channel
- **Call-first** (Video 4): Phone is king
- **🎯 OUR POSITION: SMS first for roofers, then call, then email.** Roofers are on their phones all day. They respond to texts fastest. Cold calls are second (they're used to phone communication). Email is last — many roofers barely check email. Our sequence: **Day 1 SMS → Day 2 Email → Day 3 Call → Day 5 SMS follow-up → Day 7 Loom (warm only)**

### 4. Tech Jargon vs. Plain Language
- **Some AI agency videos** use "AI automation," "n8n workflows," "chatbots"
- **Best practice** (Video 9): Focus on outcomes, not technology
- **🎯 OUR POSITION: Zero tech jargon. Period.** Say "Your phone rings more" not "AI-powered lead capture." Say "Never miss a call again" not "Automated voice agent." Roofers don't care about AI. They care about jobs and money.

### 5. Pricing: Low-ticket vs. High-ticket
- **High-ticket** (Video 5 — $3K/mo): Charge premium, fewer clients needed
- **Mid-ticket** (Our current $997-1500/mo): Accessible but still profitable
- **🎯 OUR POSITION: Start at $997-1500 to build case studies, then raise prices.** Roofers are skeptical of high prices from unknown vendors. Get 3-5 clients, deliver results, collect testimonials, THEN raise to $1500-2500/mo.

## TOP 10 TAKEAWAYS FOR PROFLUXLABS {#top-10-takeaways}

### 1. 🔥 Rewrite ALL outreach copy — ZERO tech jargon
Strip "AI," "automation," "workflows," "chatbot" from every message. Replace with outcomes: "Never miss another lead," "Your phone rings 20+ more times per month," "Get more 5-star reviews on autopilot." Roofers buy results, not technology.

### 2. 📱 Make SMS the FIRST touchpoint, not email
Roofers live on their phones on job sites. Text first, email second, call third. First text should be conversational and reference something specific about their business. Example: *"Hey Mike, saw [Company] does great work in [City] — quick question, are you guys turning away jobs right now or looking for more?"*

### 3. 🎯 Build the full GHL multi-channel sequence
Day 1: SMS hook → Day 2: Email with "noticed something" angle → Day 3: Cold call referencing previous touches → Day 5: SMS follow-up → Day 7: Loom video (warm replies only) → Day 10: Final break-up message. Automate this in GHL so it runs without manual effort.

### 4. 🎥 Systematize Loom recording with pre-pulled data
Build an n8n workflow that auto-pulls: Google Business profile, review count/rating, website screenshot, Facebook page, competitor comparison. Output a "prospect brief" so you can bang out 5-10 Looms in a focused 1-hour session. Keep each Loom under 3 minutes.

### 5. 📧 Nail the post-Loom follow-up sequence
After sending a Loom, don't just wait. Follow up: Day 1 = Loom sent with thumbnail + timestamps, Day 3 = "Did you get a chance to watch the video?", Day 5 = Call them directly, Day 7 = "Last chance" message with urgency. Most people need 3-5 touches after the Loom to book.

### 6. 💰 Add a "results guarantee" to crush objections
At $997/mo, offer: "If you don't see at least [X] new leads in your first 30 days, you don't pay." This eliminates the #1 roofer objection ("I've been burned before by marketing companies"). Confidence in your offer = more conversions.

### 7. 🏗️ Set up proper cold email infrastructure NOW
Buy 2-3 domains (profluxlabs.co, profluxlabs.io, etc.), set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC, warm them up for 2-3 weeks before sending. Use Instantly or similar for cold email (not GHL). Max 50 emails/day per domain. This is foundational — skip it and everything lands in spam.

### 8. 📞 Don't skip cold calling — it's your competitive advantage
Every other AI agency is hiding behind emails and DMs. Roofers respect people who pick up the phone. Cold call script: *"Hey [Name], this is Jason from ProFluxLabs. I sent you a text the other day about your Google listing — did you get a chance to see it? ... Great, well I found a couple things that might be costing you leads, would you have 5 minutes later today for me to walk you through it?"*

### 9. 🔍 Create a standardized "Roofer Audit Checklist"
Check every prospect for: (1) Google Business completeness, (2) Review count & recency, (3) Whether they respond to reviews, (4) Website speed + mobile, (5) Call tracking / missed calls, (6) Follow-up automation, (7) Social media activity, (8) Online booking, (9) Competitor positioning, (10) Ad presence. This makes your Looms consistently valuable and your outreach credible.

### 10. ⚡ Speed to lead — respond to replies in under 5 minutes
When a roofer texts back or replies to an email, they're interested RIGHT NOW. In 30 minutes they'll be back on a roof and forget about you. Set up push notifications for all reply channels. First person to respond wins the deal. This one habit alone could double our close rate.
