# Outreach & Growth Research — Feb 15, 2026

## 1. Cold Loom Video Outreach — What Gets Responses

**The "Trojan Horse" Strategy (proven at scale — $10M+ attributed):**

1. **Don't send the video first.** Email asks permission: *"I noticed [specific issue] on your site — mind if I share a quick video explaining?"*
2. Only record videos for people who reply → massively more scalable (1,000 emails → ~14 replies → 14 videos)
3. Video should be **3-5 min max**, lead with value, NOT a pitch
4. Show their actual website/Google listing on screen — proves it's personalized
5. End with a soft CTA: "Happy to walk you through fixing this on a quick call"

**What makes videos convert:**
- **Thumbnail matters** — show their website/business on screen so they see it's for them
- Open with their name and company — first 5 seconds determine if they watch
- Identify 2-3 real problems (missed calls, bad Google reviews response, slow follow-up)
- Show the fix conceptually without giving away the full implementation
- Personalized Loom videos get **2-5x reply rates** vs text-only cold email

**Key stat:** Intercom saw 19% reply rate using Loom in outreach (vs typical 1-3% cold email).

## 2. Follow-Up Timing & Sequences That Convert

**Optimal cadence (tested across multiple sources):**

| Touch | Timing | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Email 1 | Day 1 | Problem identification + ask to send video |
| Follow-up 1 | Day 3 | Bump — "Did you get a chance to see my note about [specific issue]?" |
| Follow-up 2 | Day 7 | New angle — share a quick stat or case study |
| Follow-up 3 | Day 14 | Breakup email — "Figured this isn't a priority, no worries" |
| Follow-up 4 (optional) | Day 21 | Final value-add or social proof |

**Critical rules:**
- **80% of deals close after the 5th+ contact** — most people give up after 1-2
- Follow up within **5 minutes** of a warm reply (100x more likely to convert)
- Each follow-up must add NEW value — don't just "bump" repeatedly
- Breakup emails often get the highest response rate (psychological trigger)
- Multi-channel works best: email → LinkedIn → Loom → email

## 3. AI Agency Scaling: 0 → 5 Clients

**Phase 1: First 1-2 clients (proof of concept)**
- Do free or deeply discounted work for 1-2 businesses to get case studies with real numbers
- Pick ONE niche (roofing ✓) — specificity sells
- Your offer should solve ONE clear problem: "We make sure you never miss a lead call again"
- Deliver results → get testimonial → get referral

**Phase 2: Clients 3-5 (repeatable offer)**
- Productize your service — same stack, same onboarding, same deliverables for every roofer
- Price on value, not hours: "$X/mo to capture every lead" not "$Y/hr for AI setup"
- Typical AI agency pricing for SMBs: $1,500-$3,000/mo retainer or $2,500-$5,000 setup + $500-$1,500/mo
- Double down on what got clients 1-2: if Loom outreach worked, scale volume
- Referrals from happy clients are 10x easier to close

**What real agencies report:**
- One AI voice agency hit $7K/mo in 2 months with retainer clients (Reddit)
- Key to scaling: templatize everything — onboarding, setup, reporting
- Pass API costs to clients on usage tiers to protect margins
- Don't add services until core offer is dialed

## 4. Handling Objections from Old-School Roofers

**⚠️ Critical insight from r/RoofingSales:** Roofers and their CUSTOMERS are often skeptical of AI on phones. One commenter: *"If I call for roofing and have to deal with AI bullshit over the phone, I'm calling someone else."*

**This means: Frame AI as a TOOL for the roofer, not a replacement for human interaction.**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't need AI, we do fine" | "You're probably leaving money on the table with missed after-hours calls. What happens when someone calls at 7pm?" |
| "My customers want to talk to a real person" | "Totally agree — the AI just captures their info and books them with YOUR team. No customer ever talks to a robot instead of you." |
| "I don't trust technology" | "It's simpler than you think — works like a smart answering service. You don't need to touch it." |
| "I can't afford it" | "If you're missing even 3-4 calls a month, that's $15-30K in lost jobs. This pays for itself with one extra booking." |
| "I tried something like this before" | "Most tools aren't built for roofers specifically. Want me to show you what we built for [competitor city roofer]?" |

**Tone rules:**
- Never say "AI" upfront — say "smart answering system" or "lead capture tool"
- Lead with MONEY: hours saved, calls captured, revenue recovered
- Use roofing-specific language: jobs, inspections, estimates, storm season
- Social proof from other roofers is king — "We do this for 12 roofers in [state]"

## 5. Creative Outreach Angles Worth Testing

### A. The "Mystery Shopper" Angle
Call their business posing as a lead. Record what happens (voicemail? long hold? no follow-up?). Show them the gap in your Loom video. *"I called your business Tuesday at 6pm — here's what happened..."* This is visceral and impossible to ignore.

### B. The Google Review Response Audit
Screenshot their Google reviews — especially unanswered negative ones. Loom video showing: "You have 3 unanswered 1-star reviews. Here's what that costs you in lost leads." Offer AI-powered review response as entry point.

### C. Storm/Season Trigger Outreach
Time outreach to storm season or seasonal peaks. *"Storm season starts in 6 weeks. Last year, roofers in [city] missed 40% of inbound calls during peak. Want to make sure that doesn't happen to you?"*

### D. The Competitor Comparison
*"I noticed [competitor] in your area is responding to leads in under 2 minutes. Here's how they're doing it — and how you can too."* (Don't name the competitor directly — imply it.)

### E. The "Free Audit" Linkedin + Loom Combo
Connect on LinkedIn first (warm the touch), then send email with Loom. Double-touch feels less cold. LinkedIn connection + personalized note → email with Loom 2 days later.

### F. Partner Channel: Roofing Supply Houses
Build relationships with roofing material suppliers. They talk to every roofer in the area. Offer them a referral cut or co-branded value.

### G. Facebook Group Infiltration
Join local contractor / roofer Facebook groups. Provide genuine value (answer questions, share tips). When people ask "how do I get more leads?" — that's your opening.

## Quick-Start Action Items

1. **This week:** Record 3 practice Loom audit videos for real roofing companies (don't send yet — get the format right)
2. **Build your hit list:** 50 roofing companies in target metro, pull from Google Maps — note their Google rating, review count, and whether they have a website
3. **Set up email sequence:** 5-touch sequence per the timing above, CTA asks permission to send video
4. **Mystery shop 5 competitors:** Call after hours, document response times — this becomes your sales ammunition
5. **Get client #1 at cost:** Offer free 30-day pilot to ONE roofer with the agreement they'll give a testimonial + case study if results are good
