# AI Automation for Roofers — Market Research Report
*ProFlux Labs | February 2026*

---

## 1. Top Pain Points Roofers Have

### 🔴 Missed Calls & Slow Response
- Roofers are on roofs, in attics, driving between jobs — they physically **cannot answer the phone** during peak hours
- Most roofing leads call 2-3 companies; whoever answers first wins. The rest never hear from that prospect again
- After-hours and weekend calls (storm damage, emergencies) go to voicemail and are rarely returned promptly
- Owner-operators wear every hat — they're the salesman, estimator, project manager, AND the receptionist

### 🔴 Lead Follow-Up Failure
- Leads from Google Ads, Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, and Facebook Ads come in but don't get followed up within minutes
- Most roofers follow up once (maybe twice) then forget — no systematic nurture sequence
- No CRM or lead tracking — leads live in text messages, voicemails, and sticky notes
- Paid leads ($50-$150+ each from lead gen platforms) go completely wasted

### 🔴 Scheduling & Appointment Management
- Double-booking, no-shows, and forgotten appointments are constant
- No automated reminders = 15-25% no-show rates on estimates
- Manual scheduling via phone tag wastes hours per week
- Seasonal demand swings (storm season, spring/summer) overwhelm small teams

### 🔴 Online Reviews & Reputation
- Roofers know reviews matter but rarely ask for them systematically
- Happy customers don't leave reviews unless prompted; unhappy ones always do
- Average roofing company has far fewer Google reviews than they should for their job volume
- Negative reviews go unresponded-to, hurting local SEO rankings

### 🔴 Administrative Overload
- Estimates, invoicing, follow-ups, insurance paperwork — no automation
- Owner works 60-80 hour weeks, most of it NOT on revenue-generating activities
- Hiring an office manager costs $35,000-$50,000/year — out of reach for many small shops

## 2. Competitor Pricing — GHL/AI Services for Roofers

### Direct GHL-Based Competitors (Roofing-Specific SaaS/Agencies)

| Competitor Type | Monthly Price Range | What's Included |
|---|---|---|
| **GHL SaaS-mode resellers** (generic) | $97-$297/mo | White-labeled GHL, basic automations, CRM |
| **Roofing-specific GHL agencies** | $297-$997/mo | GHL + roofing snapshots, pre-built funnels, lead nurture, review automation |
| **Full-service roofing marketing agencies** | $1,500-$5,000/mo | GHL + SEO, PPC, social media, AI chatbot, content |
| **AI answering/receptionist services** (Smith.ai, Ruby, Podium) | $200-$500/mo | AI or live answering, missed call text-back |
| **ServiceTitan / Jobber / Housecall Pro** | $149-$399/mo | Field service management (scheduling, invoicing, dispatching) |

### Key Pricing Insights
- **Sweet spot for SMB roofers: $297-$497/mo** — affordable enough to not think twice, valuable enough to solve real pain
- Most roofers are NOT paying for automation yet — massive greenfield opportunity
- Setup fees of $500-$2,000 are common for custom buildouts
- Competitors charging $997+/mo typically bundle ads management or lead generation

### Notable Competitors
- **Roofr** — Proposal/measurement tool, not full CRM/automation
- **AccuLynx** — Roofing CRM, $55-$100/user/mo, no AI automation
- **JobNimbus** — Roofing CRM, $25-$75/user/mo, limited automation
- **Podium** — Reviews + messaging, $249-$599/mo (not roofing-specific)
- **Housecall Pro** — $49-$199/mo, scheduling/invoicing focus
- **Generic GHL agencies** — Dozens exist; very few are roofing-specialized

### Gap in the Market
Very few competitors offer **roofing-specific AI automation** at an affordable price point. Most are either:
1. Generic GHL resellers (no roofing context)
2. Full-service agencies ($2K+/mo, overkill for small roofers)
3. CRM-only tools (no AI, no missed call text-back, no review automation)

**ProFlux opportunity: $297-$497/mo roofing-specific AI automation suite**

## 3. Automations Roofers Need Most (Priority Ranked)

### 🥇 #1: Missed Call Text-Back (HIGHEST IMPACT)
- When a call goes unanswered, automatically text the caller within 30 seconds
- "Hey! Sorry we missed your call. This is [Company Name]. How can we help with your roofing needs?"
- AI conversational follow-up to qualify the lead and book an appointment
- **Why it's #1:** Directly saves lost revenue. Immediate, tangible ROI roofers can see on day one

### 🥈 #2: Automated Review Requests
- After job completion, trigger an SMS/email asking for a Google review
- Include direct link to Google review page (1-tap review)
- Follow up 2-3 days later if no review left
- Negative sentiment detection → route to owner instead of public review
- **ROI:** Going from 20 to 100+ reviews can double inbound calls from Google

### 🥉 #3: Appointment Reminders & Confirmation
- SMS reminder 24 hours before estimate appointment
- SMS reminder 2 hours before
- Easy confirm/reschedule via text reply
- Automatically update calendar and notify the roofer
- **ROI:** Reduces no-shows from ~20% to ~5%, saving 3-4 wasted trips/week

### #4: Speed-to-Lead / New Lead Auto-Response
- Instant response to web form submissions, Facebook leads, Google Ads leads
- AI qualifies the lead: roof type, issue, address, timeline, insurance claim?
- Books estimate appointment directly into calendar
- **ROI:** Responding within 5 minutes = 100x more likely to connect vs. 30 minutes

### #5: Lead Nurture Sequences (Drip Campaigns)
- For leads who don't book immediately: 7-14 day SMS/email nurture sequence
- "Still thinking about your roof? Here's what happens if you wait..."
- Educational content: storm damage signs, insurance claim tips, before/after photos
- Re-engagement campaigns for old leads (seasonal: "Storm season is coming")

### #6: Estimate Follow-Up Automation
- After sending an estimate, auto-follow-up at day 1, 3, 7, 14
- "Hi [Name], just checking — did you have any questions about the estimate we sent?"
- Huge revenue recovery: many jobs are lost simply because nobody followed up

### #7: Referral Request Automation
- After positive review or job completion, ask for referrals
- "Know anyone else who needs roof work? We'd love to help them too."
- Offer referral incentive ($50 gift card, etc.)

## 4. Best Outreach Channels to Reach Roofers

### 🏆 Tier 1: Highest ROI Channels

**Facebook Groups (Organic + Paid)**
- Groups: "Roofing Contractors," "Roofing Sales Professionals," "Storm Chasers & Roofers," "Roofing Business Owner"
- 50,000-200,000+ members across major roofing groups
- Strategy: Provide value (tips, case studies), then DM interested commenters
- Roofers are VERY active on Facebook — it's where they network and learn
- Facebook Ads targeting roofing business owners, contractors, and related job titles

**Google Maps / GMB Scraping**
- Scrape roofing companies by city/region using tools like PhantomBuster, Outscraper, or D7 Lead Finder
- Extract: business name, phone, email, website, review count, rating
- **Key qualifier:** Companies with <50 reviews = prime prospects (need review automation)
- Companies with no website or poor website = need full digital presence help
- Scale: 500-2,000 roofing companies per metro area

**Cold Email (Targeted)**
- Use scraped data to send personalized cold emails
- Subject lines that work: "You missed 3 calls last week — here's what that cost you" / "[Company Name] — quick question about your Google reviews"
- Include a personalized Loom video showing their GMB profile and areas for improvement
- Tools: Instantly, Smartlead, Lemlist
- Expect 3-8% reply rates with good personalization

### 🥈 Tier 2: Strong Supporting Channels

**Cold Calling / Voicemail Drops**
- Ironic but effective: call roofers, and when they don't answer (they won't!), leave a voicemail about missed call automation
- "I just called and you didn't answer — that's exactly the problem I help roofers solve"
- Ringless voicemail drops at scale (Slybroadcast, Drop Cowboy)

**YouTube Content**
- "How roofers lose $100K/year from missed calls" — educational content
- Screen recordings showing the automation in action
- Roofers watch YouTube for business tips, tool reviews, and industry content

**Roofing Trade Shows & Local Events**
- International Roofing Expo (IRE) — largest roofing trade show
- Local roofing association meetings (NRCA chapters)
- BNI and local business networking groups
- Set up a booth or sponsor a lunch — very high-trust channel

**LinkedIn Outreach**
- Target roofing company owners and managers
- Less crowded than email for this demographic
- Share case studies and results posts

### 🥉 Tier 3: Supplementary Channels

**Partnerships & Referrals**
- Partner with roofing supply distributors (ABC Supply, SRS Distribution, Beacon)
- Partner with roofing software companies (non-competing: measurement tools, etc.)
- Referral deals with roofing consultants and coaches

**Direct Mail**
- Postcards to roofing companies: "Are you losing $10,000/month in missed calls?"
- Physical mail stands out — roofers are not getting marketing mail about automation
- QR code to a demo video

**Instagram / TikTok**
- Before/after content, day-in-the-life showing how automation works
- Roofers are increasingly on TikTok and Instagram
- Lower priority than Facebook but growing

## 5. Compelling Stats: What Roofers Lose from Missed Calls/Leads

### Stat 1: 85% of callers who can't reach a business won't call back
> *Source: BrightLocal / various telecom studies*
> 
> When a roofing lead calls and gets voicemail, the vast majority simply call the next roofer on Google. At an average job value of $8,000-$12,000, even one missed call per day = **$160,000-$240,000/year in lost revenue.**

### Stat 2: 78% of customers buy from the company that responds first
> *Source: Lead Connect / Harvard Business Review*
> 
> Speed to lead is everything. The first roofer to respond to an inquiry wins the job ~78% of the time. Most roofers take 24-48 hours to return calls. AI text-back responds in 30 seconds.

### Stat 3: The average small business misses 62% of incoming calls
> *Source: RingCentral / Numa research*
> 
> For roofers who are physically on job sites, the miss rate is likely even higher. If a roofer gets 10 calls/day and misses 6, at a 20% close rate and $10,000 average job, that's **$12,000/day in potential revenue going unanswered** (~$3M/year pipeline lost).

### Stat 4: Following up within 5 minutes makes you 100x more likely to connect with a lead
> *Source: InsideSales.com / MIT Lead Response Study*
> 
> After 30 minutes, the odds of qualifying a lead drop by 21x. Most roofers don't follow up for hours or days. Automated instant text-back bridges this gap completely.

### Stat 5: Businesses with 50+ Google reviews earn 266% more leads than those with fewer than 5
> *Source: BrightLocal Consumer Review Survey*
> 
> The average roofing company has 15-30 Google reviews. Automated review request sequences can 3-5x review volume within 6 months, dramatically increasing Google Maps visibility and inbound calls.
