# Scenario Playbook — Handling Every Situation

---

## SCENARIO 1: Prospect Says YES to a Demo

**What to do immediately:**
1. Book it NOW — don't let them "get back to you." Use Calendly or say "How's Tuesday at 10 AM your time?"
2. Send calendar invite within 5 minutes
3. Send confirmation text: "Hey [Name], looking forward to showing you the system on [Day] at [Time]. I'll send a quick link before we hop on. Talk soon — Jason"
4. 24 hours before: Send reminder text
5. 1 hour before: Send Zoom/Google Meet link
6. Have demo script ready (see demo-script.md)

**If they no-show:**
- Wait 10 minutes, then text: "Hey [Name], we had a call scheduled for [time] — no worries if something came up. Want to reschedule?"
- If no reply in 24 hours, call once
- If still no reply, send one more text in 3 days, then move on

## SCENARIO 2: They Want a Trial / Pilot

**The play:** Offer a limited pilot, but make it structured.

**Response:**
"I get it — you want to see it work before you commit. Here's what I can do: Let's run the system for 14 days. You'll see every missed call we catch, every lead we capture, and the follow-ups we send. If you're not seeing value by day 14, you walk away. No charge for the pilot — just the setup fee so we can build your account. Fair?"

**Pilot structure:**
- 14 days (not 30 — creates urgency)
- Setup fee still applies ($500 reduced from $1,000 — gives them a "win")
- Full Starter plan features active
- Daily/weekly report showing missed calls caught + leads captured
- Check-in call on Day 7
- Close call on Day 14

**Why this works:** Once they see missed calls being caught in real-time, they won't want to turn it off. The data sells itself.

## SCENARIO 3: They Ask for References (We Have None Yet)

**Response — Option A (Honest + Confident):**
"We're a newer agency, I'll be straight with you. But here's the thing — the technology we use isn't new. GoHighLevel powers thousands of businesses, and the missed call text-back system has been proven across hundreds of industries. What IS new is that we've packaged it specifically for roofers because nobody else has. I'd rather show you the system live and let you judge for yourself. If it doesn't make sense after the demo, no hard feelings."

**Response — Option B (Social Proof Workaround):**
"We're building our client base right now, which is actually good news for you — you get white-glove attention and priority support that our clients 6 months from now won't get. Early clients always get the best treatment. Let me show you the system and you can decide based on what you see, not what someone else says."

**Response — Option C (Offer the Pilot):**
"Tell you what — instead of taking my word for it, let's run a 2-week pilot. You'll see the results firsthand. That's better than any reference I could give you."

**Long-term fix:** Get your first 1-2 clients, overdeliver, then ask for a video testimonial and Google review within 30 days.

## SCENARIO 4: Competitor Undercuts on Price

**Response:**
"I hear you — there are cheaper options out there. But let me ask you this: when you're bidding a roofing job, do you always go with the cheapest subcontractor? Or do you go with the one you trust to get it done right?

Here's what you're getting with us: a system built specifically for roofers, not a generic template. I know your industry — I know you're on a roof at 7 AM and you can't answer calls. I know your average job is $8-15K. I built this around how YOU work.

The cheaper guys are selling you a template. We're building you a system. And honestly, at $997/month, one saved lead pays for the whole thing. The ROI isn't even close."

**If they're price-shopping hard:**
- Don't chase. "I respect that — go check them out. If you want the roofer-specific system, I'm here."
- Often they'll come back after a bad experience with the cheap option.

## SCENARIO 5: "We Already Use [Competitor/Tool]"

**Response:**
"Nice — which one are you using? [Listen]

Okay, so here's what I usually hear from roofers who switch to us: [tool] is great for [what it does], but it doesn't [key gap]. For example, does it instantly text back every missed call within 5 seconds? Does it automatically follow up 3-4 times until they book? Does it send review requests after a job?

We're not trying to replace everything you have — we layer on top of what's missing. Most roofers have a CRM but no automation. That's the gap we fill."

## SCENARIO 7: The "No Case Studies" Problem

### How to Build Social Proof FAST

**Week 1-4 (Pre-Client):**
- Build a demo GHL account for "fake" roofing company
- Record a Loom walkthrough showing the system in action
- Screenshot the dashboard with sample data
- Use these in demos and outreach

**Month 1-2 (First Client):**
- Overdeliver like crazy on your first 1-2 clients
- Track EVERY metric: missed calls caught, leads captured, appointments booked
- At Day 30, ask: "Hey [Name], we've caught [X] missed calls and [Y] leads in the first month. Would you be open to a quick 2-minute video testimonial? I'll even give you $100 off next month."
- Also ask for a Google review for ProFluxLabs

**Month 3+ (Snowball):**
- Turn testimonial into:
  - Quote for one-pager
  - Video for website
  - Screenshot for cold emails ("Check out what [Company] said after 30 days")
  - Case study blog post
- Every new client = ask for testimonial at Day 30

**The "Beta Client" Frame:**
When you have zero clients, position early adopters as "beta clients":
"We're onboarding our first 5 roofers at a discounted rate because we want to build case studies in your market. You'd get the full system at [reduced price] and priority support. In exchange, I just ask for an honest testimonial after 30 days if you're happy with the results. Deal?"

## SCENARIO 8: Client Wants to Cancel

**Response:**
"I hear you — before we process anything, can I ask what's not working? I want to make sure I haven't missed something on my end."

**Common reasons + fixes:**
- "Not seeing results" → Pull up their dashboard, show actual numbers. Often they're getting leads but not following up fast enough.
- "Too expensive" → Offer to downgrade to Starter. Show ROI math again.
- "Don't have time to use it" → Offer to manage it for them (upsell to Elite)
- "Found something cheaper" → See Scenario 4 above

**If they're firm on canceling:**
- Be gracious: "No hard feelings. I'll keep your account data for 30 days in case you change your mind. You're always welcome back."
- Ask for feedback: "What's one thing we could have done better?"
- Don't burn bridges — they might come back or refer someone
