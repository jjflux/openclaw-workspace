## THE SCRIPT

### MINUTE 0-2: Build Rapport + Set the Frame

"Hey [Name], thanks for hopping on. Before we dive in, quick question — how's business going right now? Busy season?"

> Let them talk for 30 seconds. Listen for pain points (too busy, not enough leads, hiring issues).

"Cool. So here's what we're gonna do in the next 15 minutes: I'm going to show you exactly how our system works for roofers, walk you through a live demo, and then we'll do some quick math on ROI. If it makes sense, we'll talk next steps. If not, no pressure. Sound good?"

---

### MINUTE 2-5: Establish the Problem

"So let me ask you this — when you're on a roof right now and your phone rings, what happens?"

> They'll say: voicemail, miss it, office manager sometimes gets it, etc.

"Right. And what happens to that caller when they hit voicemail? Do they leave a message?"

> Most will say no — they move on to the next roofer.

"Exactly. Here's the thing — studies show that 80% of callers who reach voicemail never call back. They just Google the next guy. For a roofing company, each of those calls could be an $8-15K job. If you're missing even 5 calls a week, that's potentially $40-75K a month walking out the door.

That's what we fix. Let me show you."

### MINUTE 5-10: The Live Demo

**Screen share the GHL dashboard.**

#### Part 1: Missed Call Text-Back (THE MONEY FEATURE)

"Alright, here's the dashboard. This is what your account would look like. Watch this —"

**Live demo:** Call the demo number from your phone. Let it ring. Show the automatic text going out within seconds.

"See that? Within 5 seconds of a missed call, the system texts them back: 'Hey, sorry we missed your call! How can we help?' Now that lead is in a conversation instead of calling your competitor. They reply, and it shows up right here in your inbox."

> Pause. Let it sink in. This is the moment that sells.

"Every single missed call. 24/7. Nights, weekends, when you're on a roof. Never lose a lead again."

#### Part 2: The Pipeline

"Now let me show you where those leads go. This is your pipeline —"

**Show pipeline stages:** New Lead → Contacted → Estimate Scheduled → Job Won → Job Lost

"Every lead gets tracked automatically. You can see at a glance how many leads are in each stage, who needs follow-up, and what your close rate looks like. No more sticky notes or forgetting to call someone back."

#### Part 3: Automated Follow-Up

"Here's where it gets really powerful. When a new lead comes in, the system doesn't just text them once — it follows up automatically."

**Show the automation sequence:**

"Text 1 goes out immediately. If they don't respond in 2 hours, Text 2 goes out. Then an email the next day. Then another text on Day 3. The system follows up 4-5 times until they either book or tell us to stop. Most roofers I talk to say follow-up is the thing they're worst at — this handles it for you."

#### Part 4: Quick Hits (If Pro/Elite Features)

- **Review automation:** "After you finish a job, the system automatically texts the homeowner asking for a Google review. More reviews = more visibility = more calls."
- **AI chat widget:** "This sits on your website. Visitor lands on your site at 11 PM, the AI chats with them, captures their info, books the estimate."
- **Online booking:** "Prospects can book an estimate time slot right from the text conversation or your website. Shows up on your calendar automatically."

### MINUTE 10-12: The ROI Moment

"Okay, let's talk numbers. What's your average job worth?"

> Let them answer. Usually $5K-$15K.

"Cool. And how many calls do you think you miss per week? Be honest."

> They'll say 2-5. The real number is usually higher.

"Let's be conservative and say you miss 5 calls a week. Even if only 1 of those turns into a job — that's $[their average job value] in revenue you're currently losing. Every single month.

Our Starter plan is $997 a month. So you're paying $997 to potentially capture $[5K-15K]+ in jobs you'd otherwise lose. That's a 5-15x return on investment. And that's just from missed calls — we haven't even talked about the follow-up sequences and review automation.

The system pays for itself with ONE saved lead. Everything after that is profit."

---

### MINUTE 12-15: The Close

**Confident close — don't be timid:**

"So here's what I'm thinking. Based on what you told me, you're definitely leaving money on the table with missed calls. The system is built for exactly your situation — you're out on jobs, phone's ringing, nobody's answering.

I can have you set up and running within a week. The Starter plan is $997/month with a $1,000 setup fee. We build everything custom for your business — your branding, your phone number, your pipeline. And there's no long-term contract — if it's not working after 90 days, you can cancel.

What do you think — ready to stop losing leads?"

---

### HANDLING THE CLOSE RESPONSES

**"Yes, let's do it"**
"Awesome. I'll send over a quick agreement and we'll get your onboarding call scheduled this week. What email should I send it to?"

**"I need to think about it"**
"Totally fair. Here's what I'd ask you to think about: every day without this running is another day of missed calls turning into lost revenue. Can I follow up with you on [specific day, 2-3 days out]? That gives you time but keeps the momentum going."

**"What about the Pro plan?"**
"Great question. Pro adds the AI chat widget for your website, review automation to boost your Google ranking, and online appointment booking. It's $1,497/month. For most roofers, if you're running Google Ads or have decent website traffic, Pro pays for itself even faster because you're capturing visitors AND missed calls. Want me to walk you through the difference?"

**"That's too expensive"**
(Use objection-handling.md responses)

**"I need to talk to my partner/wife"**
"Makes sense. Would it help if I put together a quick one-pager you can show them? And let's schedule a call for [2-3 days out] — that way we can answer any questions together."
