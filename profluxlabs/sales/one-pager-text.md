🚨 YOU'RE LOSING $5-15K JOBS EVERY TIME YOU MISS A CALL.

We make sure that never happens again.

ProFluxLabs builds AI-powered automation systems for roofing companies. We capture the leads you're currently losing — so you close more jobs without hiring more people.


THE PROBLEM

You're on a roof. Phone rings. Nobody answers. That homeowner — ready to spend $8-15K on a new roof — calls the next contractor.

The average roofer misses 5-10+ calls per week. That's potentially $50-150K/year walking out the door.


HOW WE FIX IT

→ Instant missed call text-back — Every missed caller gets a response in seconds, before they call your competitor

→ AI-powered lead capture — Website visitors and callers captured 24/7, even when you're off the clock

→ Automated follow-up — Leads get nurtured automatically via text and email until they book

→ Review automation — Happy customers get prompted to leave Google reviews, boosting your visibility

→ Appointment booking — Prospects book estimates online without needing to reach you by phone


THE ROI IS SIMPLE

Your average job = $5,000 - $15,000
Our system starts at $997/month
ONE saved lead pays for the entire system.
Everything after that is profit.
